# Advanced: Pilot Evolution

> "Evolution happens when the rider and his armor become one." - El Dora Five

As your Pilots complete missions and follow their personal hopes and dreams, they learn important **Lessons** which can unlock valuable **Evolutions**, increasing their mechanical prowess and versatility in play.


## Lessons

**Lessons** are the currency of evolution, and the core of the character advancement system. As the story plays out, the Pilots can "earn" Lessons from various in-game events.

In every scenario, Pilots should have multiple opportunities to earn Lessons. For starters, every Playbook has a built-in suggestion for ways in which that character earns Lessons. Additionally, at the end of every session, Coach will allow players to nominate others for spontaneously earned lessons, based on the events of that session.

When a Lesson is earned, the player writes it down on her Pilot record sheet. These will build up over the course of a scenario, with highly active Pilots potentially able to earn a handful or more.

Regardless of source, a Pilot can have at most seven (7) Lessons written down on her record sheet at any one time. If she has some lingering for a while, she may want to erase old stinky ones to make room for new, more promising ones.


### The Lesson Votes

At the end of every game scenario (or at proper mid-points of particularly long scenarios), during the "Debriefing" stage of play, Coach will run the Lessons vote. Start with the earned lessons, and then move to nominated lessons. During this time, each Pilot is eligible to potentially earn *up to three (3)* total new Evolutions: 1 from their earned Lessons, 1 from unexpected bonus Lessons, and finally 1 more from being voted MVP.

**Earned Lessons (1 Evolution):** Going once around the table clockwise from Coach, each player takes turns nominating *one* item on her list of recorded earned lessons. If she believes that her Pilot has learned from that Lesson, then she must pitch her case for this aloud to the rest of the group. If they agree with her, she marks off that Lesson as "learned" and gives herself one new Evolution. Only one earned Lesson at a time is eligible for this; all other lessons remain written down to be revisited later.

Not every Lesson will (or should!) be Learned from! This is important! Some Lessons might linger for multiple sessions and even scenarios before the group believes they've been learned from. Others will never be Learned from, and can be crossed off the list entirely without bonus. This works best when you think of your Pilots as *people* and not merely as game tools. Since your Pilot has a limit of seven active Lessons at any one time, you may want to erase old ones that have been around for a while if you're not likely to ever learn from them!

**Bonus Lessons (1 Evolution):** With that cycle complete, each player (including Coach!) who wishes can then *choose* to nominate one Pilot *other than herself* for a whole new previously-unrecorded lesson she might have earned in that session of play. Think hard on this: did any other Pilot show noteworthy character growth in response to any particular story events? If so, call them out on it, and then discuss with the group for a majority approval. Each Pilot thus called out and voted on gets one more bonus Evolution, on the spot. Try and call out different Pilots for recognition, as a Pilot called out more than once still only gets the single bonus Evolution.

**MVP Vote (1 Evolution):** Finally, the Pilots must then nominate each other for Most Valuable Pilot of that scenario. Who came through the strongest? Whose idea saved the day? Who carried the rest on their back? This should be an open discussion, and in the end the group will vote on who they think was the most awesome Pilot in the recent story sessions. If there's a tie, Coach breaks it. The winner gets one more Evolution.


## Applying Evolutions

When you earn an Evolution, you get to spend it to unlock a new character enhancement. These advancements progress in a repeating cycle of threes-and-sevens:

1. Tech Evolution
2. Tech Evolution
3. Commitment Evolution
4. Tech Evolution
5. Tech Evolution
6. Commitment Evolution
7. Class Advancement

After the seventh evolution, the cycle begins again from the start, and repeats as such until your character dies or graduates from play.

#### Tech Evolutions

**Tech Evolutions** allow you to level-up any one Tech within your three power categories (Chroma, Weapon, and Robo). You can increase the level of one ability you already have, or instead unlock the first level of a Tech you don't have yet. You must choose from those Techs available to your chosen Chroma, Weapon, and Robo, and cannot choose from others. Your Playbooks have the basics all ready for you to choose from.

There is one other major restriction in play here: you cannot evolve the same category back to back. So if your previous level-up was within your Chroma Techs, for example, then for your next level-up you must instead choose within your Weapon or Robo techs.

#### Commitment Evolutions

**Commitment Evolutions** allow you to choose a new descriptive adjective to describe yourself based on your portrayal in the story thus far. Along with this adjective comes a +1 increase to any one of your six core stats - which in turn also increases its associated Commitment's balance maximum. This increase must narratively fit the nature of the chosen adjective. Talk to your team for suggestions, as they just may know your Pilot better than you do! Additionally, at this time you may *choose* to shift a single point within all three of your Commitments, based on your shifting motivations and goals from current play.

#### Class Advancement

At every seventh evolution, instead of repeating the three-step process above, you "level up" through what is called a **Class Advancement**, and acquire a new Class Rank at your battle school. All new Pilots begin play as Freshmen, with all the basic abilities established through their core Playbooks. As they move up to Sophomore rank and beyond, they gain more core grounding in play, including increased Hands and access to more and better Gear.

At each Class Advancement, your Pilot acquires the following:

* **Class Rank:** Your Class Rank increases from Freshman to Sophomore, and then Junior, and then Senior, and finally Graduate. These terms are mainly just story flavor, but they also provide an easy gauge of character power.
* **Hand Size:** Your Max Hand increases by **one (1)** card. For Black, this increases your Void.
* **Gear Slots:** You gain one additional Gear Slot of either Armor, Accessory, or Tool type.

**Class Advancement Reference Table:**

| Class     | Hand | Gear Slots | Gear Tier  |
|-----------|------|------------|------------|
| Freshman  | 3    | 3          | 1          |
| Sophomore | 4    | 4          | 2          |
| Junior    | 5    | 5          | 3          |
| Senior    | 6    | 6          | 4          |
| Graduate  | 7    | 7          | [REDACTED] |


### Universal Techs

There are four special "Universal" Techs that all Pilots have access to, regardless of their Chromas. Whenever you earn a Tech Evolution, you can choose to level up one of the Universal Techs instead. Like all Techs, each of the four Universal Techs has three ranks of evolution. These Techs are detailed below:


##### Buffer Tech

Evolving this Tech increases your maximum Buffer Pool by +1 per Evolution rank.


##### Card Tech

Evolving this Tech gives you more card options in play, with the following rewards:

* Rank 1: Increases your base Bonus Draw by +1
* Rank 2: Increases your base Bonus Draw by +1 (for a total of +2)
* Rank 3: Increases your base Hand Size by +1


##### Charge Tech

Evolving this Tech increases your Pilot's maximum Charge Pool, with the following rewards:

* Rank 1: Increase your Charge Pool max by +1
* Rank 2: Increase your Charge Pool max by +2 (for a total of +3)
* Rank 3: Increase your Charge Pool max by +3 (for a total of +6)


##### Strike Tech

Evolving this Tech increases your base Strike Range by +1 per Evolution rank.


### Restoring Damaged Commitments

If any of your Pilot's Commitment balances is lower than 6, you can choose to spend a Tech evolution to instead restore a single point to that Commitment (and thus increase one of its Stats). This does not apply a new adjective, nor does it otherwise alter the cycle of evolution.


## Loadouts: Switching Chromas, Weapons, and Robos

Although I am a strong believer that a Pilot's Chroma, style, and chosen mecha deeply echo her own inner nature in an intensely personal way, no player should be forced to stick with their initial choices if they feel like trying out other character options over time. While changing your Chroma should be reserved for extremely rare matters of powerful story growth, changing your Weapon and Robo can be as simple as writing them down and swapping them out at the beginning of a new mission.

For these occasions, use the **Alternate Evolution Pilot Sheet**. This allows you to track different Chromas, Weapons, and Robos that you evolve over time. Following the standard Evolution cycle, acquiring a new Role, Weapon, or Robo can be as simple as investing a single Evolution to acquire its first Tech rank.

There is an important restriction here to note: **You can only use the Techs of one Chroma, Weapon, and Robo at a time.** When you change into a different Chroma suit, you *become* that Chroma. When you choose to pilot a certain Robo, you are bonded with that Robo *alone*. And you can only wield a single special Power Weapon at any one time. Coach may choose to allow you to freely swap between Tech "loadouts" throughout the same Scenario, but you cannot use the Techs of multiple Chromas, Weapons, or Robos on the same mission. Swapping these out should only be done at the Team's home base, and only at dramatically-relevant times.

Note that this kind of loadout-swapping can result in a non-trivial amount of additional bookkeeping, not to mention uncertainty in storytelling. As such we recommend discussing this heavily with your fellow players at the table before doing this too often.

(**PLAYTEST NOTE 2019:** this sheet is definitely planned, but still in development. For now, just note the differences on scratch paper)


## Veteran-Level Evolution

Since each Tech has at most three ranks of empowerment, there may come a point down the line in your Pilot's career where she has maxed out her entire ability allowances across her original Chroma, Weapon, and Robo. When you reach this point of Evolution, you are referred to as a **Veteran** Pilot. Veterans have a few "advanced" options to choose from.


### Graduation

The first option, of course, is **Graduation**. This involves your Pilot leaving the team in some way, but still sticking around in the background of the story. Perhaps she joins the Academy as an instructor, guiding new classes of rookies. Perhaps she joins one of the various crews of the base, lending her arm as a mechanic or taking over as the quartermaster of the armory. Or maybe instead she ventures out with the fleet to take the battle to a new quadrant, carrying on the fight outside of the Team.

Regardless of reasoning, the graduated Pilot leaves play, and you can make a new character from scratch.


### "Locking-in" Techs

If you want to keep playing as the same Pilot, another option at this point is to start "locking in". This method allows you to use the Loadouts option above, while also accessing cross-playbook Techs. To do this, each new Tech Evolution that you spend allows you to lock in a single rank of a Tech that you already know in any of your Loadouts. That tech then onward is available to you at that locked rank, no matter what other loadouts you switch to.

For example, a veteran Green Pilot could spend a Tech Evolution to lock in the first rank of her "I've Got This!" Passive Tech. She could then switch to another Chroma, and still keep using that Green Tech at rank 1. She can spend more Evolutions to then increase the locked-in rank, or start locking in other fully-mastered techs.


# Advanced: Factions

**Factions** are other groups, parties, individuals, or even esoteric external forces that have narrative agency in a particular scenario - in other words, any non-Pilot force that has power within the story (including the types of characters that would be called "non-player" in other role-playing games). Factions that are uncovered during play can be wooed for Favor, allowing players to invest cards in them for later use.

The Faction mechanic is primarily a way for the Pilots to increase their future versatility by externalizing their power. By getting more cards out onto the table, they set themselves up to have more options of play during later conflicts.


## Anatomy of a Faction

A Faction in play is usually represented by an index card put out in the middle of the table, or possibly a sideboard, for all involved to see. Unlike Locations, Faction cards should be laid out flat, face-up. During play, stacks of the Pilots' playing cards may build up on these Factions as they invest in them for later use.

Every Faction has the following core components:

* **Agency Rating:** How much relative story power the Faction has (higher = stronger)
* **Favor Cards:** A stack of cards representing power invested in the Faction
* **Offense Tokens:** A pile of tokens that build up as the Pilots upset the Faction
* **+Favor Trigger:** Several ways the Pilots can gain the Faction's favor
* **+Disfavor Trigger:** Several ways the Pilots can piss the Faction off


### Agency Rating

Every Faction has a primary numerical rating that represents their **Agency** in the story. This number can be as low as 1 for a relatively weak force, or as high as 7 for an extremely powerful and useful force.

The Faction's Agency does two things. For the Pilots, it limits the maximum number of favor cards that can ever be invested in the Faction at one time. For Coach, it also determines that Faction's relevant **Threat Rating** should it ever turn against the Pilots (see Threat details in the Coach section).


### Favor Cards

Throughout play the Pilots can earn opportunities to cultivate friendships and alliances with the various Factions in play. Doing so allows the Pilots to invest their own cards into the Factions as **Favor** cards, to be used in later conflicts as external sources of additional power. Favor Cards are tracked by a literal stack of playing cards on top of the Factions at the table. See below for more details.


### +Favor Triggers

**+Favor Triggers** are narrative ways that the Pilots can get on a Faction's good side. When Coach feels that the Pilots have performed one or more of these deeds, he will allow them to invest Favor as per the +Favor microevent. Examples of things that might woo a Faction include:

* Giving them money
* Rescuing a missing ally/relative
* Providing them defensive assistance
* Assisting around their Community
* Taking in one of their young as a recruit

See Investing Favor, below (p. SQUARP) for more details.


### +Disfavor Triggers

Similarly, **+Disfavor Triggers** are Faction-specific ways in which the players can upset that Faction.  When any of these happen, a **+Disfavor** microevent is triggered (see p. SQUARP). This can lead to angry Factions, and even turn them into new Threats!


## Introducing a New Faction

Coach will have a number of Factions pre-written and ready for use as part of his scenario design prep. Whenever the Pilots are made aware of a particular Faction's existence, Coach sets that Faction's detail card out on the table for all to see, noting its Agency on the card. This doesn't need to be an elaborate ritual, but for the purposes of efficient play it is important for the Pilots to know when they've met or otherwise discovered valuable potential allies.


### "Predisposed" Factions

A not-uncommon event in a story is the introduction of a Faction that comes pre-loaded with some amount of Favor. The sudden arrival of a fleet of homeworld allies, the group of kids they rescued five sessions ago, the Official Mecha Pilot Fan Club, and so on. If Coach feels that a newly-introduced Faction is predisposed to favor the Pilots *and* immediately back them up in a conflict, then he may allow them to immediately invest one or more Favor cards as a group when that Faction is placed out on the table.


## Courting a Faction

To gain power from a Faction, the Pilots must first narratively gain that Faction's trust. This can be done however the players see fit, really. It's all role-playing. Once Coach feels the Faction has been sufficiently impressed, he may allow them to invest Favor. Mechanically, this is called a **+Favor Trigger** and may at times be built directly into other situations in advance. Triggering a +Favor event allows the Pilots the opportunity to invest cards into the Faction, as detailed below.


### Investing Favor

When a Pilot triggers +Favor, she takes a card and places it face-up on that Faction. She can use any card from:

* Her current Hand
* Any other existing and invested Faction that is relevant to the situation (allowing her to shift externalized power among different Factions)
* The topmost card of the Deck

If there are already cards on the Faction, flip the topmost card face-down and place the new one face up on top. In this fashion, the stack of cards grows taller with only the topmost card visible.


#### Investment Limits

A Faction can never have more invested Favor cards than its Agency rating. Players *can* still invest additional cards into maxxed-out Factions, but each card they add over its limit forces the bottom card to be discarded.


#### Investment Strategy

Since there's no maximum value when investing Favor, it may be tempting to just throw in a high card immediately and bank it for later. However, since only the topmost card is available at any one time, it pays to spread them out, and have someone try to remember what cards are where. This text recommends starting with a lower card and building up a nice numerically-arranged stack, especially on high-Agency Factions.


## Using Favor

Factions exist primarily as a method for the Pilots to build up more card-play options by externalizing their power, and Favor cards represent that in action. Favor cards that are *face-up* on a Faction represent immediately-available power that the Faction can lend the Pilots during conflicts. Face-up Favor cards can be played by a Pilot in any situation where the rules demand that the Pilot play a card, with the added requirement that she spontaneously narrate aloud how that Faction is assisting her at that moment. This includes Gambits, Throwdowns, and Rumbles.

**To play a Favor card,** take the topmost card from its Faction and play it in front of you, per the rules of the moment that are demanding your play. If there is a face-down Favor card beneath the card you just took, flip it and leave it on that Faction for later use. No matter how many cards are invested in that Faction, you can only ever play the topmost card on its stack.

The narrative assistance can be direct, such as a member of that Faction taking immediate action in the Pilot's stead. It can instead be indirect, such as someone in the Faction having provided the Pilot intel before this conflict.


## Causing Offense to a Faction

When the Pilots narratively distress, offend, or piss off a Faction, this activates a +Disfavor trigger. Unless somehow mitigated, +Disfavor triggers result in the accrual of Offense tokens placed on top of the Faction's index card on the table.

Factions follow the standard "three strikes and you're out!" rule of decorum. This means that a Faction can have no more than two Offense tokens on it at any time. If ever it would acquire a third token, it is either removed from play or worse: converted into a new Threat (see below).

Coach can offer the removal of Offenses as rewards for narrative actions the Pilots might take in order to heal social wounds and make amends for their offenses.


### Enraged Factions: New Threats!

At Coach's discretion, any Faction that accrues three Offenses may directly turn against the players, directing its efforts to actively bring them down. This results in the Faction transforming into a new Threat, with its Agency converting directly into its new Threat Rating. Use the standard Threat-building rules to give the Threat powers (see p. SQUARP).

All invested Favor cards on a Threat-converted Faction are discarded.


## Hurting/Destroying Factions

Factions can be hurt by some Threat Techs, which can either reduce their Agency or outright remove them from play. However, this probably won't happen all that often in your games. And if it ever gets to the point that the Pilots are trying to take out a Faction, that Faction is probably already a mechanical Threat with its own rules for defeat - and if it isn't, it's probably past the time to make it one!


## Example Factions


#### Yoshi the Flower Boy (Agency 1)

* **Agency:** 1
* **Favor Triggers:** Buy his flowers, treat him kindly, invite him out
* **Disfavor Triggers:** Insult his profession, humiliate him, spit on his flowers

That adorable kid from the slums who sells flowers and keeps an ear open to the word on the streets...


#### Belle Bugg Banger's Crew (Agency 3)

* **Agency:** 3
* **Favor Triggers:** give them intel, help them smuggle, give them a good deal
* **Disfavor Triggers:** Sell them out, renege a deal, be too pushy

A team of local smugglers who have an angle on all local goings-on...


#### *The Salient Witch* (Agency 5)

* **Agency:** 5
* **Favor Triggers:** Offer them first salvage rights, compliment captain's outfit, get them drunk
* **Disfavor Triggers:** fight them, sell them to authorities, be too goody-goody

A famous space cruiser piloted by a famous space corsair...


#### The United Galactic Fleet (Agency 7)

* **Agency:** 7
* **Favor Triggers:** Defend earth, respect protocol, assist their crew
* **Disfavor Triggers:** Cause too much destruction, get in their way, suck at your duties

The grand fleet of the Galactic Government, here to enforce the martial will of Earth!



# Advanced: Locations & Base-Building

**Locations** are mechanical representations of "places where things happen" in a game of *Gattaibushido:FUSION!*. Locations give valuable Boons and abilities to the Pilots, who must do their best to protect them from the ravages of their enemies, as well as their own reckless actions.


## Anatomy of a Location

Every Location has the following core components:

* **Boons:** One or more special effects the Pilots can access while at that Location.
* **State:** The Location's current state of being: **Standing**, **Damaged**, and **Razed**.


### Boons

Each Location provides a special game effect called a **Boon**, which the Pilots can utilize while engaged with that Location. As long as the Location isn't completely Razed, the Boon can be used whenever the Pilots are present at that location, or otherwise in a capacity to make special remote use of it.

Many Boons make use of the **+Tarry** mechanic, which allows Coach to push time forward, and along with it increase the danger of Crisis escalation. Any Location Boon which requires a Tarry action effectively triggers the +Tarry microevent.


#### Example Location Boons

**Barracks, Bunker, and Hangar:** These three locations are default to every new team, and described on p. SQUARP. Each provides a Boon in the form of a special Team Resource.

**The Barter Barn:** Once per session, the group can +Tarry here to exchange any of their other Resources for Armory points on a 1:1 basis.

**CyberDome:** An elite technological training center, the group can +Tarry here to get prepped for coming battles, allowing each Pilot present to discard and draw 1 card per +Tarry action.

**Hope Monument:** During any conflict at the Hope Monument, the Team has +2 to its Buffer vs +Schism only.

**Medical Bay:** A single Pilot can +Tarry here to restore 1 point of temporary Commitment damage.

**Mega-Bunker Neo-New-Oldtown III:** This Location contains a number of other locations within it. It has a special pool of its own three Buffer tokens, which are used to prevent +Ruin triggers against it or any Locations inside of it.

**Otaku District:** While visiting the Otaku District of the city, the Team can interface directly with their Fan Club as if they were back at Base. Additionally, all Fan Club actions have double the outcome.

**Sacred Hot Springs:** By +Tarrying a turn at the Hot Springs, each present Pilot restores 1 spent Buffer.

**TacOps Center:** If the group +Tarries here, they can each swap a single card from their Hand with others in the group.

**Ultralopolis IV:** With all the buildings and human shields, it's easier to avoid getting hurt here. During any conflict here, each Pilot has +1 to their Max Buffer.


### Structural States

<NEEDS IMAGE EXAMPLE>

Each Location exists in one of three states: **Standing** (aka "Up"), **Damaged** (aka "flipped"), and **Razed** (aka "Torn") - the names reference both the structural sates and their index card representations at the table. Unless otherwise determined by the story, all Locations enter play in an Up state - meaning, their cards are introduced to the table face-up, folded and standing like a tent. While in the Up state, the Location is in a fully-functional condition, and its Boons are completely accessible.

A Location that has been damaged by a **+Ruin** microevent is put into a Damaged or "Flipped" state. When this happens, flip the tent card to its side, so that it now stand perpendicular to the table. While in this state the Location is still functional and its Boon accessible, but it's now just one wrong move away from destruction.

Finally, a location hit with multiple +Ruin microevents can enter an unfortunate final Razed state. At this point, the Location has been destroyed beyond all ability to use its shelter or Boons. To represent this, take the tent card and tear it in half, and then take a moment of silence to lament its loss.


#### Repairing Locations

As long as the Location isn't Razed, restoring damage is a matter of successful conflicts and application of Heart cards. The Pilots need only achieve a **+Rebuild** effect from their conflicts in order to restore a Damaged Location to fully Standing.

A Razed Location, however, requires additional effort to repair. There is no default mechanical method for doing this. Instead, Coach will determine a suitable mission or "quest" that must be completed if the team wishes to rebuild a Razed Location. Once that mission is completed, the Razed "status" is removed, and the Location is restored to a Damaged/Flipped state - functional now, but it still needs more work.

The actual mission itself can be as quick or as involved as Coach deems appropriate. Restoring a Razed Location can even be the core focus of an entire new follow-up scenario.


## Introducing a New Location

To build a Location, first give it a backstory and determine how it will be important to your current tale. Then give it at least one Boon, and possibly optional Setback or two, to spice things up.

The easiest way to represent in-game Locations at the game table is by using Index cards, providing a quick visual reference for the locations' State. Each time you introduce one, grab a new index card and fold it in half so it stands up like a tent, with the folded edge pointing up. One one side of the tent write the Location's name, and on the other write a quick note about its boon.


## Upgrading Locations

Over the course of an extended campaign, the Pilots can work on upgrading Locations that they find particularly useful. Similarly to rebuilding a Razed Location, upgrading a favorite haunt is a good narrative goal for more than just one or two conflicts. In such a situation, Coach will develop a side mission for the Pilots to fulfill, possibly making connections with the right building crew, acquiring special materials and components, and more. Once complete, he may offer the group an option to finally upgrade the chosen Location.

Upgrades can include:

* Increased Occupancy (such as +1 Pilot at the med Bay)
* Increased Boons (from 1 to 2, from 2 to ??, or such)
* Built-in damage Buffer
* Diminished or eliminated Setbacks (PLAYTEST)


## Team Base-Building!

(**PLAYTESTING:** TBD)

Involves using post-scenario Score to add more locations to their base.


## Threat Locations

**Playtest Notes:** One obvious option for this system is to provide Locations that primarily benefit Coach's Threats. These would have Boons of their own, which benefit only the Threats. I'm still considering this. One consideration is that I've planned a number of drawbacks in the system that damage locations as unfortunate consequences of the Pilots' actions. As such, the option to turn those unfortunate consequences into assets when attacking the bad guys might be too powerful and broken when dealing with enemy Locations. I need to get more feedback before delving deeper into this idea.
