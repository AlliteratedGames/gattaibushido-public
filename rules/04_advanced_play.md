# Advanced: Pilot Evolution

> "Evolution happens when the rider and his armor become one." - El Dora Five

As your Pilots complete missions and follow their personal hopes and dreams, they learn important **Lessons** which can unlock valuable **Evolutions**, increasing their mechanical prowess and versatility in play.


## Lessons

**Lessons** are the currency of evolution, and the core of the character advancement system. As the story plays out, the Pilots can "earn" Lessons from various in-game events.

In every scenario, Pilots should have multiple opportunities to earn Lessons. For starters, every Playbook has a built-in suggestion for ways in which that character earns Lessons. Additionally, at the end of every session, Coach will allow players to nominate others for spontaneously earned lessons, based on the events of that session.

When a Lesson is earned, the player writes it down on her Pilot record sheet. These will build up over the course of a scenario, with highly active Pilots potentially able to earn a handful or more.

Regardless of source, a Pilot can have at most seven (7) Lessons written down on her record sheet at any one time. If she has some lingering for a while, she may want to erase old stinky ones to make room for new, more promising ones.


### The Lesson Votes

At the end of every game scenario (or at proper mid-points of particularly long scenarios), during the "Debriefing" stage of play, Coach will run the Lessons vote. Start with the earned lessons, and then move to nominated lessons. During this time, each Pilot is eligible to potentially earn *up to three (3)* total new Evolutions: 1 from their earned Lessons, 1 from unexpected bonus Lessons, and finally 1 more from being voted MVP.

**Earned Lessons (1 Evolution):** Going once around the table clockwise from Coach, each player takes turns nominating *one* item on her list of recorded earned lessons. If she believes that her Pilot has learned from that Lesson, then she must pitch her case for this aloud to the rest of the group. If they agree with her, she marks off that Lesson as "learned" and gives herself one new Evolution. Only one earned Lesson at a time is eligible for this; all other lessons remain written down to be revisited later.

Not every Lesson will (or should!) be Learned from! This is important! Some Lessons might linger for multiple sessions and even scenarios before the group believes they've been learned from. Others will never be Learned from, and can be crossed off the list entirely without bonus. This works best when you think of your Pilots as *people* and not merely as game tools. Since your Pilot has a limit of seven active Lessons at any one time, you may want to erase old ones that have been around for a while if you're not likely to ever learn from them!

**Bonus Lessons (1 Evolution):** With that cycle complete, each player (including Coach!) who wishes can then *choose* to nominate one Pilot *other than herself* for a whole new previously-unrecorded lesson she might have earned in that session of play. Think hard on this: did any other Pilot show noteworthy character growth in response to any particular story events? If so, call them out on it, and then discuss with the group for a majority approval. Each Pilot thus called out and voted on gets one more bonus Evolution, on the spot. Try and call out different Pilots for recognition, as a Pilot called out more than once still only gets the single bonus Evolution.

**MVP Vote (1 Evolution):** Finally, the Pilots must then nominate each other for Most Valuable Pilot of that scenario. Who came through the strongest? Whose idea saved the day? Who carried the rest on their back? This should be an open discussion, and in the end the group will vote on who they think was the most awesome Pilot in the recent story sessions. If there's a tie, Coach breaks it. The winner gets one more Evolution.


## Applying Evolutions

When you earn an Evolution, you get to spend it to unlock a new character enhancement. These advancements progress in a repeating cycle of threes-and-sevens:

1. Tech Evolution
2. Tech Evolution
3. Commitment Evolution
4. Tech Evolution
5. Tech Evolution
6. Commitment Evolution
7. Class Advancement

After the seventh evolution, the cycle begins again from the start, and repeats as such until your character dies or graduates from play.

#### Tech Evolutions

**Tech Evolutions** allow you to level-up any one Tech within your three power categories (Chroma, Daisho, and Robo). You can increase the level of one ability you already have, or instead unlock the first level of a Tech you don't have yet. You must choose from those Techs available to your chosen Chroma, Daisho, and Robo, and cannot choose from others. Your Playbooks have the basics all ready for you to choose from.

There is one other major restriction in play here: you cannot evolve the same category back to back. So if your previous level-up was within your Chroma Techs, for example, then for your next level-up you must instead choose within your Daisho or Robo techs.

##### Evolving Chroma Techs



##### Evolving Daisho Techs

When you choose to evolve a Daisho, you can either add a new Quality to an existing Daisho in your collection, or instead acquire a new base weapon frame to add to your collection. You cannot add more than three Qualities to any single Frame.


##### Evolving Robo Techs




#### Commitment Evolutions

**Commitment Evolutions** allow you to choose a new descriptive adjective to describe yourself based on your portrayal in the story thus far. Along with this adjective comes a +1 increase to any one of your six core stats - which in turn also increases its associated Commitment's balance maximum. This increase must narratively fit the nature of the chosen adjective. Talk to your team for suggestions, as they just may know your Pilot better than you do! Additionally, at this time you may *choose* to shift a single point within all three of your Commitments, based on your shifting motivations and goals from current play.

#### Class Advancement

At every seventh evolution, instead of repeating the three-step process above, you "level up" through what is called a **Class Advancement**, and acquire a new Class Rank at your battle school. All new Pilots begin play as Freshmen, with all the basic abilities established through their core Playbooks. As they move up to Sophomore rank and beyond, they gain more core grounding in play, including increased Hands and access to more and better Gear.

At each Class Advancement, your Pilot acquires the following:

* **Class Rank:** Your Class Rank increases from Freshman to Sophomore, and then Junior, and then Senior, and finally Graduate. These terms are mainly just story flavor, but they also provide an easy gauge of character power.
* **Hand Size:** Your Max Hand increases by **one (1)** card.
* **Gear Slots:** You gain one additional Gear Slot of either Armor, Accessory, or Tool type.

**Class Advancement Reference Table:**

| Class     | Hand | Gear Slots | Gear Tier  |
|-----------|------|------------|------------|
| Freshman  | 3    | 3          | 1          |
| Sophomore | 4    | 4          | 2          |
| Junior    | 5    | 5          | 3          |
| Senior    | 6    | 6          | 4          |
| Graduate  | 7    | 7          | [REDACTED] |


### Universal Techs

There are four special "Universal" Techs that all Pilots have access to, regardless of their Chromas. Whenever you earn a Tech Evolution, you can choose to level up one of the Universal Techs instead. Like all Techs, each of the four Universal Techs has three ranks of evolution. These Techs are detailed below:


##### Buffer Tech

Evolving this Tech increases your maximum Buffer Pool by +1 per Evolution rank.


##### Card Tech

Evolving this Tech gives you more card options in play, with the following rewards:

* Rank 1: Increases your base Bonus Draw by +1
* Rank 2: Increases your base Bonus Draw by +1 (for a total of +2)
* Rank 3: Increases your base Hand Size by +1


##### Charge Tech

Evolving this Tech increases your Pilot's maximum Charge Pool, with the following rewards:

* Rank 1: Increase your Charge Pool max by +1
* Rank 2: Increase your Charge Pool max by +2 (for a total of +3)
* Rank 3: Increase your Charge Pool max by +3 (for a total of +6)


##### Strike Tech

Evolving this Tech increases your base Strike Range by +1 per Evolution rank.


### Restoring Damaged Commitments

If any of your Pilot's Commitment balances is lower than 6, you can choose to spend a Tech evolution to instead restore a single point to that Commitment (and thus increase one of its Stats). This does not apply a new adjective, nor does it otherwise alter the cycle of evolution.


## Loadouts: Switching Chromas, Daisho, and Robos

Although I am a strong believer that a Pilot's Chroma, style, and chosen mecha deeply echo her own inner nature in an intensely personal way, no player should be forced to stick with their initial choices if they feel like trying out other character options over time. While changing your Chroma should be reserved for extremely rare matters of powerful story growth, changing your Daisho and Robo can be as simple as writing them down and swapping them out at the beginning of a new mission.

For these occasions, use the **Alternate Evolution Pilot Sheet**. This allows you to track different Chromas, Daiso, and Robos that you evolve over time. Following the standard Evolution cycle, acquiring a new Role, Daisho, or Robo can be as simple as investing a single Evolution to acquire its first Tech rank.

There is an important restriction here to note: **You can only use the Techs of one Chroma, Daisho, and Robo at a time.** When you change into a different Chroma suit, you *become* that Chroma. When you choose to pilot a certain Robo, you are bonded with that Robo *alone*. And you can only wield a single special Daisho at any one time. Coach may choose to allow you to freely swap between Tech "loadouts" throughout the same Scenario, but you cannot use the Techs of multiple Chromas, Daisho, or Robos on the same mission. Swapping these out should only be done at the Team's home base, and only at dramatically-relevant times.

Note that this kind of loadout-swapping can result in a non-trivial amount of additional bookkeeping, not to mention uncertainty in storytelling. As such we recommend discussing this heavily with your fellow players at the table before doing this too often.

(**PLAYTEST NOTE 2019:** this sheet is definitely planned, but still in development. For now, just note the differences on scratch paper)


## Veteran-Level Evolution

Since each Tech has at most three ranks of empowerment, there may come a point down the line in your Pilot's career where she has maxed out her entire ability allowances across her original Chroma, Daisho, and Robo. When you reach this point of Evolution, you are referred to as a **Veteran** Pilot. Veterans have a few "advanced" options to choose from.


### Graduation

The first option, of course, is **Graduation**. This involves your Pilot leaving the team in some way, but still sticking around in the background of the story. Perhaps she joins the Academy as an instructor, guiding new classes of rookies. Perhaps she joins one of the various crews of the base, lending her arm as a mechanic or taking over as the quartermaster of the armory. Or maybe instead she ventures out with the fleet to take the battle to a new quadrant, carrying on the fight outside of the Team.

Regardless of reasoning, the graduated Pilot leaves play, and you can make a new character from scratch.


### "Locking-in" Techs

If you want to keep playing as the same Pilot, another option at this point is to start "locking in". This method allows you to use the Loadouts option above, while also accessing cross-playbook Techs. To do this, each new Tech Evolution that you spend allows you to lock in a single rank of a Tech that you already know in any of your Loadouts. That tech then onward is available to you at that locked rank, no matter what other loadouts you switch to.

For example, a veteran Green Pilot could spend a Tech Evolution to lock in the first rank of her "I've Got This!" Passive Tech. She could then switch to another Chroma, and still keep using that Green Tech at rank 1. She can spend more Evolutions to then increase the locked-in rank, or start locking in other fully-mastered techs.

## Threat Locations

**Playtest Notes:** One obvious option for this system is to provide Locations that primarily benefit Coach's Threats. These would have Boons of their own, which benefit only the Threats. I'm still considering this. One consideration is that I've planned a number of drawbacks in the system that damage locations as unfortunate consequences of the Pilots' actions. As such, the option to turn those unfortunate consequences into assets when attacking the bad guys might be too powerful and broken when dealing with enemy Locations. I need to get more feedback before delving deeper into this idea.
