# Advanced: Pilot Evolution

As your Pilots complete missions and follow their personal hopes and dreams, they learn important **Lessons** which can unlock valuable **Evolutions**, increasing their mechanical prowess and versatility in play.


## Lessons

**Lessons** are the currency of evolution, and the core of the character advancement system. As the story plays out, the Pilots can "earn" Lessons from various in-game events.

In every scenario, Pilots should have multiple opportunities to earn Lessons. For starters, every Playbook has a built-in suggestion for ways in which that character earns Lessons. Additionally, at the end of every session, Coach will allow players to nominate others for spontaneously earned lessons, based on the events of that session.

When a Lesson is earned, the player writes it down on her Pilot record sheet. These will build up over the course of a scenario, with highly active Pilots potentially able to earn a handful or more.

Regardless of source, a Pilot can have at most seven (7) Lessons written down on her record sheet at any one time. If she has some lingering for a while, she may want to erase old stinky ones to make room for new, more promising ones.


### The Lesson Votes

At the end of every game scenario (or at proper mid-points of particularly long scenarios), during the "Debriefing" stage of play, Coach will run the Lessons vote. Start with the earned lessons, and then move to nominated lessons. During this time, each Pilot is eligible to potentially earn *up to three (3)* total new Evolutions: 1 from their earned Lessons, 1 from unexpected bonus Lessons, and finally 1 more from being voted MVP.

**Earned Lessons (1 Evolution):** Going once around the table clockwise from Coach, each player takes turns nominating *one* item on her list of recorded earned lessons. If she believes that her Pilot has learned from that Lesson, then she must pitch her case for this aloud to the rest of the group. If they agree with her, she marks off that Lesson as "learned" and gives herself one new Evolution. Only one earned Lesson at a time is eligible for this; all other lessons remain written down to be revisited later.

Not every Lesson will (or should!) be Learned from! This is important! Some Lessons might linger for multiple sessions and even scenarios before the group believes they've been learned from. Others will never be Learned from, and can be crossed off the list entirely without bonus. This works best when you think of your Pilots as *people* and not merely as game tools. Since your Pilot has a limit of seven active Lessons at any one time, you may want to erase old ones that have been around for a while if you're not likely to ever learn from them!

**Bonus Lessons (1 Evolution):** With that cycle complete, each player (including Coach!) who wishes can then *choose* to nominate one Pilot *other than herself* for a whole new previously-unrecorded lesson she might have earned in that session of play. Think hard on this: did any other Pilot show noteworthy character growth in response to any particular story events? If so, call them out on it, and then discuss with the group for a majority approval. Each Pilot thus called out and voted on gets one more bonus Evolution, on the spot. Try and call out different Pilots for recognition, as a Pilot called out more than once still only gets the single bonus Evolution.

**MVP Vote (1 Evolution):** Finally, the Pilots must then nominate each other for Most Valuable Pilot of that scenario. Who came through the strongest? Whose idea saved the day? Who carried the rest on their back? This should be an open discussion, and in the end the group will vote on who they think was the most awesome Pilot in the recent story sessions. If there's a tie, Coach breaks it. The winner gets one more Evolution.


### ALTERNATE METHOD: The Lessons Tally (PLAYTEST)

(**PLAYTEST NOTE:** This is an alternate "classic XP" version I'm considering instead. It simply replaces the above section, and really needs to be tested out. Established gamers may find this more comfortable, and thus its inclusion for consideration.)

In short, this alternate method involved earning lessons like XP. You earn lessons, and after earning 7 lessons you unlock a new Evolution.

In this method, Lessons are earned in the following three ways:

* You automatically gain 1 Lesson per session in which you played.
* You earn a lesson each time your Color's Lesson Trigger activates.
* At the end of a scenario (or midpoint in a long story), everyone discusses whether you "truly learned anything at all," potentially earning you one more lesson.


## Applying Evolutions

When you earn an Evolution, you get to spend it to unlock a new character enhancement. These advancements progress in a repeating three-step cycle:

**Your First and Second Evolutions** allow you to level-up any one Tech within your three power categories (Color, Weapon, and Robo). You can increase the level of one ability you already have, or instead unlock the first level of a Tech you don't have yet. You must choose from those Techs available to your chosen Color, Weapon, and Robo, and cannot choose from others. Your Playbooks have the basics all ready for you to choose from.

There is one other major restriction in play here: you cannot evolve the same category back to back. So if your previous level-up was within your Color Techs, for example, then for your next level-up you must instead choose within your Weapon or Robo techs.

**Your Third Evolution** allows you to choose a new descriptive adjective to describe yourself based on your portrayal in the story thus far. Along with this adjective comes a +1 increase to any one of your three Commitments, which must fit the nature of the chosen adjective. Talk to your team for suggestions, as they just may know your Pilot better than you do! Additionally, at this time you may *choose* to shift a single point between any two of your current Commitments, based on your shifting motivations and goals from current play.

**All subsequent Evolutions** follow the same repeating cycle. Thus the fourth and fifth evolutions again level up your techs, the sixth adds another adjective and Commitment rank, and so on.



# Advanced: Factions

**Factions** are other groups, parties, individuals, or even esoteric external forces that have narrative agency in a particular scenario - in other words, any non-Pilot force that has power within the story (including the types of characters that would be called "non-player" in other role-playing games). Factions that are uncovered during play can be wooed for Favor, allowing players to invest cards in them for later use.

The Faction mechanic is primarily a way for the Pilots to increase their future versatility by externalizing their power. By getting more cards out onto the table, they set themselves up to have more options of play during later conflicts.


## Anatomy of a Faction

A Faction in play is usually represented by an index card put out in the middle of the table, or possibly a sideboard, for all involved to see. Unlike Locations, Faction cards should be laid out flat, face-up. During play, stacks of the Pilots' playing cards may build up on these Factions as they invest in them for later use.

Every Faction has the following core components:

* **Agency Rating:** How much relative story power the Faction has (higher = stronger)
* **Favor Cards:** A stack of cards representing power invested in the Faction
* **Strike Tokens:** A pile of tokens that build up as the Pilots upset the Faction
* **+Favor Trigger:** Several ways the Pilots can gain the Faction's favor
* **+Disfavor Trigger:** Several ways the Pilots can piss the Faction off


### Agency Rating

Every Faction has a primary numerical rating that represents their **Agency** in the story. This number can be as low as 1 for a relatively weak force, or as high as 7 for an extremely powerful and useful force.

The Faction's Agency does two things. For the Pilots, it limits the maximum number of favor cards that can ever be invested in the Faction at one time. For Coach, it also determines that Faction's relevant **Threat Rating** should it ever turn against the Pilots (see Threat details in the Coach section).


### Favor Cards

Throughout play the Pilots can earn opportunities to cultivate friendships and alliances with the various Factions in play. Doing so allows the Pilots to invest their own cards into the Factions as **Favor** cards, to be used in later conflicts as external sources of additional power. Favor Cards are tracked by a literal stack of playing cards on top of the Factions at the table. See below for more details.


### +Favor Triggers

**+Favor Triggers** are narrative ways that the Pilots can get on a Faction's good side. When Coach feels that the Pilots have performed one or more of these deeds, he will allow them to invest Favor as per the +Favor microevent. Examples of things that might woo a Faction include:

* Giving them money
* Rescuing a missing ally/relative
* Providing them defensive assistance
* Assisting around their Community
* Taking in one of their young as a recruit

See Investing Favor, below (p. SQUARP) for more details.


### +Disfavor Triggers

Similarly, **+Disfavor Triggers** are Faction-specific ways in which the players can upset that Faction.  When any of these happen, a **+Disfavor** microevent is triggered (see p. SQUARP). This can lead to angry Factions, and even turn them into new Threats!


## Introducing a New Faction

Coach will have a number of Factions pre-written and ready for use as part of his scenario design prep. Whenever the Pilots are made aware of a particular Faction's existence, Coach sets that Faction's detail card out on the table for all to see, noting its Agency on the card. This doesn't need to be an elaborate ritual, but for the purposes of efficient play it is important for the Pilots to know when they've met or otherwise discovered valuable potential allies.


### "Predisposed" Factions

A not-uncommon event in a story is the introduction of a Faction that comes pre-loaded with some amount of Favor. The sudden arrival of a fleet of homeworld allies, the group of kids they rescued five sessions ago, the Official Mecha Pilot Fan Club, and so on. If Coach feels that a newly-introduced Faction is predisposed to favor the Pilots *and* immediately back them up in a conflict, then he may allow them to immediately invest one or more Favor cards as a group when that Faction is placed out on the table.


## Courting a Faction

To gain power from a Faction, the Pilots must first narratively gain that Faction's trust. This can be done however the players see fit, really. It's all role-playing. Once Coach feels the Faction has been sufficiently impressed, he may allow them to invest Favor. Mechanically, this is called a **+Favor Trigger** and may at times be built directly into other situations in advance. Triggering a +Favor event allows the Pilots the opportunity to invest cards into the Faction, as detailed below.


### Investing Favor

When a Pilot triggers +Favor, she takes a card and places it face-up on that Faction. She can use any card from:

* Her current Cache
* Any other existing and invested Faction that is relevant to the situation (allowing her to shift externalized power among different Factions)
* The topmost card of the Deck

If there are already cards on the Faction, flip the topmost card face-down and place the new one face up on top. In this fashion, the stack of cards grows taller with only the topmost card visible.


#### Investment Limits

A Faction can never have more invested Favor cards than its Agency rating. Players *can* still invest additional cards into maxxed-out Factions, but each card they add over its limit forces the bottom card to be discarded.


#### Investment Strategy

Since there's no maximum value when investing Favor, it may be tempting to just throw in a high card immediately and bank it for later. However, since only the topmost card is available at any one time, it pays to spread them out, and have someone try to remember what cards are where. This text recommends starting with a lower card and building up a nice numerically-arranged stack, especially on high-Agency Factions.


## Using Favor

Factions exist primarily as a method for the Pilots to build up more card-play options by externalizing their power, and Favor cards represent that in action. Favor cards that are *face-up* on a Faction represent immediately-available power that the Faction can lend the Pilots during conflicts. Face-up Favor cards can be played by a Pilot in any situation where the rules demand that the Pilot play a card, with the added requirement that she spontaneously narrate aloud how that Faction is assisting her at that moment. This includes Gambits, Throwdowns, and Rumbles.

**To play a Favor card,** take the topmost card from its Faction and play it in front of you, per the rules of the moment that are demanding your play. If there is a face-down Favor card beneath the card you just took, flip it and leave it on that Faction for later use. No matter how many cards are invested in that Faction, you can only ever play the topmost card on its stack.

The narrative assistance can be direct, such as a member of that Faction taking immediate action in the Pilot's stead. It can instead be indirect, such as someone in the Faction having provided the Pilot intel before this conflict.


## Accruing Strikes

When the Pilots narratively distress, offend, or piss off a Faction, this activates a +Disfavor trigger. Unless somehow mitigated, +Disfavor triggers result in the accrual of Strike tokens placed on top of the Faction's index card on the table.

Factions follow the standard "three strikes and you're out!" rule of decorum. This means that a Faction can have no more than two Strike tokens on it at any time. If ever it would acquire a third token, it is either removed from play or worse: converted into a new Threat (see below).

Coach can offer the removal of Strikes as rewards for narrative actions the Pilots might take in order to heal social wounds and make amends for their offenses.


### Enraged Factions: New Threats!

At Coach's discretion, any Faction that accrues three Strikes may directly turn against the players, directing its efforts to actively bring them down. This results in the Faction transforming into a new Threat, with its Agency converting directly into its new Threat Rating. Use the standard Threat-building rules to give the Threat powers (see p. SQUARP).

All invested Favor cards on a Threat-converted Faction are discarded.


## Hurting/Destroying Factions

Factions can be hurt by some Threat Techs, which can either reduce their Agency or outright remove them from play. However, this probably won't happen all that often in your games. And if it ever gets to the point that the Pilots are trying to take out a Faction, that Faction is probably already a mechanical Threat with its own rules for defeat - and if it isn't, it's probably past the time to make it one!


## Example Factions


#### Yoshi the Flower Boy (Agency 1)

* **Agency:** 1
* **Favor Triggers:** Buy his flowers, treat him kindly, invite him out
* **Disfavor Triggers:** Insult his profession, humiliate him, spit on his flowers

That adorable kid from the slums who sells flowers and keeps an ear open to the word on the streets...


#### Belle Bugg Banger's Crew (Agency 3)

* **Agency:** 3
* **Favor Triggers:** give them intel, help them smuggle, give them a good deal
* **Disfavor Triggers:** Sell them out, renege a deal, be too pushy

A team of local smugglers who have an angle on all local goings-on...


#### *The Salient Witch* (Agency 5)

* **Agency:** 5
* **Favor Triggers:** Offer them first salvage rights, compliment captain's outfit, get them drunk
* **Disfavor Triggers:** fight them, sell them to authorities, be too goody-goody

A famous space cruiser piloted by a famous space corsair...


#### The United Galactic Fleet (Agency 7)

* **Agency:** 7
* **Favor Triggers:** Defend earth, respect protocol, assist their crew
* **Disfavor Triggers:** Cause too much destruction, get in their way, suck at your duties

The grand fleet of the Galactic Government, here to enforce the martial will of Earth!



# Advanced: Locations & Base-Building

**Locations** are mechanical representations of "places where things happen" in a game of *Gattaibushido:FUSION!*. Locations give valuable Boons and abilities to the Pilots, who must do their best to protect them from the ravages of their enemies, as well as their own reckless actions.


## Anatomy of a Location

Every Location has the following core components:

* **Boons:** One or more special effects the Pilots can access while at that Location.
* **Setbacks:** (PLAYTEST/OPTIONAL) One or more negative side effects of hanging out at this Location
* **State:** The Location's current state of being: **Standing**, **Damaged**, and **Razed**.


### Boons

Each Location provides a special game effect called a **Boon**, which the Pilots can utilize while engaged with that Location. As long as the Location isn't completely Razed, the Boon can be used whenever the Pilots are present at that location, or otherwise in a capacity to make special remote use of it.

Many Boons make use of the **+Tarry** mechanic, which allows Coach to push time forward, and along with it increase the danger of Threat Escalation. Any Location Boon which requires a Tarry action effectively triggers the +Tarry microevent.


#### Example Location Boons

**Barracks, Bunker, and Hangar:** These three locations are default to every new team, and described on p. SQUARP. Each provides a Boon in the form of a special Team Resource.

**The Barter Barn:** Once per session, the group can +Tarry here to exchange any of their other Resources for Armory points on a 1:1 basis.

**CyberDome:** An elite technological training center, the group can +Tarry here to get prepped for coming battles, allowing each Pilot present to discard and draw 1 card per +Tarry action.

**Hope Monument:** During any conflict at the Hope Monument, the Team has +2 to its Buffer vs +Strife only.

**Medical Bay:** A single Pilot can +Tarry here to restore 1 point of temporary Commitment damage.

**Mega-Bunker Neo-New-Oldtown III:** This Location contains a number of other locations within it. It has a special pool of its own three Buffer tokens, which are used to prevent +Ruin triggers against it or any Locations inside of it.

**Otaku District:** While visiting the Otaku District of the city, the Team can interface directly with their Fan Club as if they were back at Base. Additionally, all Fan Club actions have double the outcome.

**Sacred Hot Springs:** By +Tarrying a turn at the Hot Springs, each present Pilot restores 1 spent Buffer.

**TacOps Center:** If the group +Tarries here, they can each swap a single card from their Cache with others in the group.

**Ultralopolis IV:** With all the buildings and human shields, it's easier to avoid getting hurt here. During any conflict here, each Pilot has +1 to their Max Buffer.


### Setbacks - NEW 2018 RE-ORG

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** This is a new idea, needs some work and input.

Ideas:

* Due to cramped spaces, all Push actions in Robos here add +Ruin triggers


### Structural States

<NEEDS IMAGE EXAMPLE>

Each Location exists in one of three states: **Standing** (aka "Up"), **Damaged** (aka "flipped"), and **Razed** (aka "Torn") - the names reference both the structural sates and their index card representations at the table. Unless otherwise determined by the story, all Locations enter play in an Up state - meaning, their cards are introduced to the table face-up, folded and standing like a tent. While in the Up state, the Location is in a fully-functional condition, and its Boons are completely accessible.

A Location that has been damaged by a **+Ruin** microevent is put into a Damaged or "Flipped" state. When this happens, flip the tent card to its side, so that it now stand perpendicular to the table. While in this state the Location is still functional and its Boon accessible, but it's now just one wrong move away from destruction.

Finally, a location hit with multiple +Ruin microevents can enter an unfortunate final Razed state. At this point, the Location has been destroyed beyond all ability to use its shelter or Boons. To represent this, take the tent card and tear it in half, and then take a moment of silence to lament its loss.


#### Repairing Locations

As long as the Location isn't Razed, restoring damage is a matter of successful conflicts and application of Heart cards. The Pilots need only achieve a **+Rebuild** effect from their conflicts in order to restore a Damaged Location to fully Standing.

A Razed Location, however, requires additional effort to repair. There is no default mechanical method for doing this. Instead, Coach will determine a suitable mission or "quest" that must be completed if the team wishes to rebuild a Razed Location. Once that mission is completed, the Razed "status" is removed, and the Location is restored to a Damaged/Flipped state - functional now, but it still needs more work.

The actual mission itself can be as quick or as involved as Coach deems appropriate. Restoring a Razed Location can even be the core focus of an entire new follow-up scenario.


## Introducing a New Location

To build a Location, first give it a backstory and determine how it will be important to your current tale. Then give it at least one Boon, and possibly optional Setback or two, to spice things up.

The easiest way to represent in-game Locations at the game table is by using Index cards, providing a quick visual reference for the locations' State. Each time you introduce one, grab a new index card and fold it in half so it stands up like a tent, with the folded edge pointing up. One one side of the tent write the Location's name, and on the other write a quick note about its boon.


## Upgrading Locations

Over the course of an extended campaign, the Pilots can work on upgrading Locations that they find particularly useful. Similarly to rebuilding a Razed Location, upgrading a favorite haunt is a good narrative goal for more than just one or two conflicts. In such a situation, Coach will develop a side mission for the Pilots to fulfill, possibly making connections with the right building crew, acquiring special materials and components, and more. Once complete, he may offer the group an option to finally upgrade the chosen Location.

Upgrades can include:

* Increased Occupancy (such as +1 Pilot at the med Bay)
* Increased Boons (from 1 to 2, from 2 to ??, or such)
* Built-in damage Buffer
* Diminished or eliminated Setbacks (PLAYTEST)


## Team Base-Building!

(**PLAYTESTING:** TBD)

Involves using post-scenario Score to add more locations to their base.


## Threat Locations

**Playtest Notes:** One obvious option for this system is to provide Locations that primarily benefit Coach's Threats. These would have Boons of their own, which benefit only the Threats. I'm still considering this. One consideration is that I've planned a number of drawbacks in the system that damage locations as unfortunate consequences of the Pilots' actions. As such, the option to turn those unfortunate consequences into assets when attacking the bad guys might be too powerful and broken when dealing with enemy Locations. I need to get more feedback before delving deeper into this idea.



# Advanced: FUSION!

Fuze, Combine, Merge, Drift - whatever form it takes in your game world, Gattai Pilots have the spectacular ability to physically combine their powers together, merging into more powerful **Fusions** that can kick even more monster butt! In ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!***, the Pilots can merge their abilities into two different forms of Fusion: **Lesser Fusions**, and the **Final Form**. This section details the rules of Lesser Fusions, while Final Forms are detailed in the next chapter (see . SQUARP).

A Lesser Fusion is a meta-state that two or more Pilots can enter, allowing them to merge all of their individual personal abilities and resources together as a single combined unit. This creates powerful strategic opportunities for them in Throwdowns, and an experienced team of Pilots can dominate lesser Threats with skilled application of Fusion.


##### ("Classic vs Modern Fusions" Sidebar)

> During character creation, your group should have specifically discussed the nature of your team's Fusion ability, and exactly how it manifests during play. Some teams may prefer a more "classic" experience, as defined by stories like *Voltron* and *Dai-Guard*. This means that "Fusions" are limited to a more traditional full-team assembly, requiring the entire group to be present, in their respective operational Robos, and joining up to assemble the Final Form and defeat the Big Giant Monster.
>
> This limitation will mean that the "Lesser Fusion" rules won't apply to your game, but that's totally awesome! It's not an absolutely crucial component of core play, thus its inclusion in the Advanced Rules. While the Lesser Fusions are pretty fun and strategically engaging, they also add more elements to play that can slow things down. By excluding them from your game, you'll miss out on them, but at the same time you'll make those Robo Rumbles all the more exciting when they finally arrive and the team gets to break out their secret weapons!
>
> For fans of other fiction, such as *Vandread*, *Aquarion*, and *Steven Universe*, the Lesser Fusion rules give your team more options to play out those kinds of stories. You still get to Robo Rumble in your Final Forms at the end, but you also get to play out Fusion on a more personal scale, too!


##### ("Robos Required... or not?" Sidebar)

> Another important consideration from your game setup session is whether or not your Fusions require your Robos. This will set limitations on how your Pilots activate their Fusions. By default, this game assumes that Robos will be required, and flavors the text accordingly. The vast majority of the inspirational gattai genre fiction is built on this assumption, so we're going with that as the standard. However, a number of other works have characters who Fuze directly, no Robo required, and we want to be able to allow that option as well. Again, this is a subject for group discussion.
>
> Regardless of this decision, if your Pit Crew is 0, you *still* can't Fuze. That's just how the rules work!


## Fusion: How it Works

During a Throwdown, two or more players can **Fuze** together to merge their assets into a stronger singular entity.


### Requirements

In order to Fuze, the following requirements must be met:

* The Team's Harmony must not be in the Red.
* All Pilots who wish to Fuze must be present, active, and in their Robos. (Note: see Sidebar)
* One Pilot must use the **FUSION!** Side Action on her Turn, and ask others to join her.
* The others involved must agree to the Fusion.

If all the requirements are met, it's time for FUSION!


### The Fusion

Once Fusion is initiated, the Fuzed Pilots join together as a special meta-player called the **Lesser Fusion**, with the following rules:

* **Cache:** The Lesser Fusion's Cache is equal to the combined Caches of all Fuzed Pilots.
* **Charges:** The Lesser Fusion's Charge Pool is equal to the combined Charges of all Fuzed Pilots.
* **Techs:** The Lesser Fusion has access to all the Techs possessed by the Fuzed Pilots.

**Harmonic Effects:** Additionally, based on the Team's current Harmony, the Fusion may gain or lose additional Charges or Cards. See the Harmony table on p. SQUARP.

**Turns and Actions:** The Fusion acts as a single player on the Initiating Pilot's turn in the rotation. The other Pilots are temporarily removed from the turn rotation until the Fusion ends. As a single Player, the Fusion only gets one Main Action per turn, but the players of the Fuzed Pilots can now actively strategize over which action to take.

**Duration:** The Fusion lasts for as many of the acting Pilot's turns in the rotation as the current Team Harmony rank (2 to 7 turns, maximum), starting with the turn on which the Fusion was formed, and concluding immediately following the resolution of the Fusion's chosen Main Action on its final turn of the count. The Fusion can choose to voluntarily break by using the same **FUSION!** Side Action on any of its later turns.

**Conclusion:** When a Fusion terminates, the following occurs:

* **Cache:** Discard a number of additional cards equal to the number of Turns the Fusion existed. If there are any left in the combined Cache, divide them between the now un-Fuzed Pilots as you see fit.
* **Charges:** Reduce the combined Charges by the same number. If there are Charges remaining, divide them similarly.
* **Rotation:** All Pilots return to their initial spots in the rotation, and the turns continue as per normal rules. If the breakup occurred during the Fusion's own turn as a Side Action, it reverts to being that active Pilot's turn.
* **Harmony Burn:** If the Fusion ends with zero cards in the final Cache *and* zero Charges in the final Pool *after* the discards above, then it is a particularly nasty breakup, and Team Harmony immediately drops by 1! This damage is immediate, direct, and unblockable.

**Disruption:** A Fusion can be preemptively broken by a +BREAK! Wave or Storm actions. If this happens, the dissolution of the Fusion is immediate, and follows the rules above.


### Fusion Strategies - WORKING 2018

**Strategize as a Team:** As the leading Pilot in a Fusion, the combination of your teammates' powers can give you a *lot* of versatility that can be quite overwhelming. You won't be as familiar with their powers, but that's okay, we don't expect you to be. It works best if you all gather at your side of the table and pow-wow. This is the *only* time during play where you are not only allowed to game-talk, but you're also expected to. Just don't do it too loudly, or your opponent might hear what you are planning!

**Take your time:** Your first few Fusions will probably take a long time to figure out. Don't rush it, just take your time to plan with your team. Over multiple plays you'll know each others' grooves well enough that eventually it will be almost second nature. We're all here to have fun, so let's all be patient while we figure this out, right?

**Maximize your Harmonic synergy:**

**Get Kings out on the table:** After a Fusion ends, you will all likely have near-empty personal Caches, if any cards at all. If the Throwdown keeps raging onward, this could be disastrous. Plan ahead and invest Kings into your Factions, so you can use them to get more cards mid-battle if you need to fight on.

**Watch out for the burn:**



# Advanced: Robo Rumbles and the Final Form! (Conflict Type 4)

How to form up and fight the big giant monster!


## Robo Rumble Basics

When Coach finally reveals the presence of the **Big Giant Monster**, your Team can finally join together to assemble your ultimate **Final Form**, and hopefully kick that monster's butt! This moves play into a special new Team vs Coach strategy game mode called the **Robo Rumble**. After a quick bit of card initiative, your Team describes the grand combination of your glorious assembled ultimate fusion, and each of states which **Position** you will take in the Final Form.

Then, after a bit of drawing-up of initial power, your Team squares off against Coach in a three-round match of hand-building and card-play, describing increasingly awesome moves while building up combo points. At the end, the side with the most points wins the day!


## The Final Form

The term **Final Form** in this text refers to the ultimate assembled mega-bot that the team creates when they combine their Robos into a greater fusion. Unlike Lesser Fusions, the Final Form combines the *entire* Team, and takes the battle to an entirely new scale of conflict and stakes when introduced.


### What Does it Look Like?

Every group will have their own description of what the union process looks, sounds, feels, smells, and even tastes like, as well as their own description of that actual final assembled form. For the purposes of tension, we encourage new groups to *not* go into any details at first, and instead wait until the first time in play that it actually happens to describe everything. This makes that first union all the more awesome for everyone.


### Final Form Positions

The Final Form ultimately consists of a set of **Positions** that the Pilots take up as their robots combine with each other. There are Five (5) core Positions based on their function within the assembled structure. Each position gives a special Rumble action option that the Pilot in that Position can use, and has suggestions on its incarnation within your form.

For tangible play at the table, we recommend using a set of index cards to represent the Positions, with each Pilot's player actually taking that index card into their play region when they assume that position during the union process.

Each Position's special action can be used once per Round of the Rumble, on the turn of the Pilot in that Position, instead of playing a card into one of the Combo Zones. When you use a Rumble action, you must discard a card from your Cache. Most actions have a variable effect based on the current Robo Rank of the Pilot using the action. This variable is represented by "X" in the action descriptions below.


#### Strategy ("The Head")

* **Suggested Forms:** Head, Brains, Eyes

**Action: "On My Mark!:"** Each other Pilot in the Final Form may choose to pass you up to X cards from their Caches. You may then choose to keep any of those passed to you, and then pass each of them up to X cards back. The amount they passed you and the amount you pass back do not need to be the same.


#### Offense ("Right Arm")

* **Suggested Forms:** Right Arm, Chest Laser, Blazing Sword

**Action: "(INSERT ATTACK NAME):"** Each time you use this, you must shout out a new attack name. You cannot use the same attack name twice in the same Rumble, but you can recycle them across multiple Rumbles and sessions. You can then force a random discard of up to X cards from Coach's Cache. This cannot force Coach to discard the final card in his Cache.


#### Defense ("Left Arm")

* **Suggested Forms:** Left Arm, Shell, Power Shield

**Action: "(INSERT MANEUVER NAME):"** Each time you use this, you must shout out a new defensive maneuver name. You cannot use the same maneuver name twice in the same Rumble, but you can recycle them across multiple Rumbles and sessions. *Instead* of discarding a card, play a card (same or different) face-down in front of an already-played BGM card. When the cards are revealed at the end of the Round, if your card Beats theirs, immediately discard both (it does not score) and then draw X cards into your Cache.


#### Perseverance ("Heart")

* **Suggested Forms:** Heart, Spine

**Action: "Rejuvenation!:"** Each *other* Pilot in the Final Form draws X more cards into their Cache.


#### Mobility

* **Suggested Forms:** Legs, Tail, Wings

**Action: "Flank Maneuver!:"** When used, discard up to X cards, then name X+1 other Pilots who get to take immediate free additional turns (these do not count against the five-turn limit).

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** This may be broken, too OP. Not sure, need additional table data.


#### UNSORTED TECH IDEAS:

* Sacrifice a play in order to increase possible Score Multiplier
* Look at X cards in any Cache, on the table, or in any Faction
* flip up to X played cards for all to see
* Force opponent to reveal and take back a played card, and replace it with a different one from their Cache?



### So When Do We Get to Form Up, Anyway?

The previously-described Lesser Fusion rules are great for small-scale conflicts, but you're probably wondering when you get to form up into the big Final Form and really kick some monster butt?

The truth is that there's really no reason to bring out the Final Form until triggered by the story and Coach's Escalation Path, when the Big Giant Monster comes in to destroy everything. Since the Robos themselves are primarily narrative tools, the players can have their Robos whenever they like, provided it makes sense. And using Lesser Fusions, they can sync up on a smaller playing field as needed, without going full-on Final Form.

Much like the classics of the genre, the actual team robo combination is an intense action, and can be quite destructive. This can directly limit their usefulness within the game world of your story. You can easily narrate certain limitations, such as:

* It just takes too much power!
* Combination makes us *literally die* a little each time, so we have to conserve ourselves.
* The government only gives us license to use them when absolutely necessary, and the mountain of paperwork is just too much.
* The destructive forces are too strong that we have to contain them until it's out only option.
* ...and so on.

Additionally, there *are* some mechanical considerations:

* **Harmony:** You want to be at your best before you join your robos together for the Final Form, and your Team's Harmony limits your options there. So you may need to spend some time soul-searching in order to get to a point where your combinations truly excel. **Remember: when Harmony is in the Red, you can't combine at all!**
* **External Power:** Robo Rumbles require a *lot* of cards in order to win, so it helps to spend time in advance getting as many cards out there into Factions as you can.
* **Pit Crew:** The battles you get in with your Robos can really put a beating on them. You need a good Pit Crew that'll keep your team's giant steeds in tip-top shape.

In any case, the actual act of assembling only happens at the beginning of Rumbles, and as such that process is described further below, in the Rumble outline.




## Okay, Let's Rumble!

The Robo Rumble is the big final throw-down between the assembled Pilots and the BGM. A Rumble is played out in exactly three Rounds of action. The Pilots join together on one side of the fight, and Coach run the Big Giant Monster on the other side.

**Robo Rumble Process:**

1. Initiate
2. Assemble!
	* Pilot Robo Final Form!
	* The Monster Appears!
3. RUMBLE
	1. Round 1
		* Pilots Draw Up
		* Coach Draws Up
		* Play
	1. Round 2
		* Coach Draws Up
		* Play
	1. Round 3
		* Coach Draws Up
		* Play
4. Determine Outcome


### Step 1: Initiating the Rumble

A Rumble can be activated either within an active Throwdown, or outside of one, based on the following rules.


#### From Within a Throwdown

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** This is still being considered. I might scrap the mid-Throwdown initiation entirely, and require that it only initiate outside of an active conflict.

To activate within a Throwdown:

**Pilot:** On your turn, use the "Let's Rumble!" Main action.

**Coach:** Once the appropriate escalation stage is reached, Coach can initiate at any time during a Throwdown involving a Threat that has the BGM Power. This also uses the "Let's Rumble!" main action.

**In either case**, once the Rumble has been initiated, the Throwdown is officially over. Immediately resolve it with the highest card on the Pile determining the victor as usual. Then discard the play pile, but ***leave existing Caches as they are!*** Now begin Step 2.


#### From Outside a Throwdown

A Rumble can be activated in "open play" mode by either the Pilots or Coach.

**Pilot:** Simply narrate that you are starting the fusion.

**Coach:** Same as if done within a Throwdown.

**In either case,** Immediately begin Step 2.


### Step 2: Assemble!

Now each side assembles at the same time. When both are ready to go, move to Step 3.


#### Pilots: Building the Final Form

For some, this may be the most exciting part of the game: the team finally gets to assemble into their mega-ultra-magna-tron-bot, hooray!

To form the mega bot, each Pilot in the union claims one of the available Positions of the Final Form. In larger groups, there may be more Pilots involved than available Positions, but that's fine: once all the core positions are claimed, remaining pilots can "double up" in a claimed Position, effectively claiming it a second time (and also making that Tech available for two uses in a Round!). However, doubling up is not allowed if there are still core positions remaining unclaimed.

When you claim a Position, if there are any Power tokens on that Position, you immediately draw one more card into your Cache for each token.

Then, each Pilot in the union contributes to the description of the combination! This can be quite a vivid and spectacular event, so the players are encouraged to go wild, especially on their first union (and Coach, this is a special Pilot moment, so don't butt in unless they need assistance with imaginative ideas or prodding). For best dramatic impact, we advise starting with the "lower" Positions (legs, tail, etc) and working up until you bring in the uppermost Position (usually the Head) last - "...and I'll form the HEAD!" is a classic trope of the genre.


##### What if we can't get to our Robos?

**PLAYTEST:** This is a good question. My current idea is that if the BGM attacks but the Pilots can't fight it, then each subsequent Omen used unleashes a world of destruction upon the setting and the scenario. The Pilots would need to scramble something fierce in order to pull together and fight it before all is lost! I'm still working on this one.


#### Coach: Assembling the Playing Field

While the Pilots are describing their Union, Coach should prepare the playing field. Just clear out a space in the middle for each side to lay out **two rows of up to five cards each**. Don't put any cards there yet (that will happen during the Rounds), just make sure there's space to play. These play spaces are called **Combo Zones**, and each side has five of them.

As for the monster itself, Coach doesn't really have to do anything special to assemble the BGM other than describe how totally sweet it is. The BGM Techs should have been predetermined during the Scenario Design process. Just wait for the Pilots to assemble, encourage them to be super descriptive, and then move on the Step 3.


### Step 3: Rumble!

Now you fight! This is a set of three "**Rounds**" of action. Each Round is broken down into ten **Turns** of the sides using Techs or building power combos. It's a back-and-forth flow, with one side taking a turn, then the other, then back, and so on until each side has taken five turns. At the end of a Round, you total a score based on card combos and multipliers, then proceed to the second Round and repeat. Repeat a third time, and it's over. Highest total score wins!

**TL;DR:** Three Rounds, ten turns in each Round, five turns per side back and forth, highest score at the end wins.


#### Round One: FIGHT!

First, you Draw-Up:

**Draw-Up (Pilots):** At the start of Round 1 Only, the Pilots each draw additional cards equal to their current personal Robo Ranks. Pilots do not need to discard anything at the start. Pilots do not automatically draw more cards on each subsequent round, and instead must rely on their Positions' Rumble Techs in order to gain more power.

**Draw-Up (Coach):** At the start of *each* Round, Coach Draws up to a total Cache equal to the current Escalation Stage rank (plus any other bonuses he may have from specific Threat Techs). If Coach somehow already has more than that in his Cache, he needs to *randomly* discard down to the max size.

**Order of Play:** After the initial draw, the first turn goes to the side that initiated Rumble Mode. When you bring it, you act first.

Initiator takes a turn, then the opponent, back and forth until each side has taken five turns. If there are multiple players on a side, they can act in any order they want - meaning if there are five Pilots in a union, they can even just have one player choose and declare all the actions. They only get five turns, but they can do whatever they want with them.

**What You Can Do:** On your Side's turn, you can *either* play a card face-down in one of your side's five Combo Zones, *or* you can instead activate your special Position/BGM Tech.

**To play a card** in a Combo Zone, take a card from your Cache (or a Faction) and place it face-down in an empty one of the five zones for your side of the battle. Give everyone a description of your Robo or BGM making an advance, attack, or some other suitably awesome maneuver. This card will be revealed at the end of the round, and count toward your score combo.

**To Use a Tech,** Play a card from your Cache (or a Faction) *face-up and sideways* on an empty Zone on your side. This activates your Rumble Tech and empowers it with the card: the better the card you play, the more effective the Tech (see Tech descriptions, earlier). Apply the effects immediately. Remember: using a Tech is done *instead* of playing a card, and that directly limits the number of cards your side can play, so do so wisely!

Each Rumble Tech can only be used once per side, unless your side has it otherwise duplicated (such as doubled-up Pilots, of BGMs with multi-use Techs).

Finally, once all ten turns are complete, determine the Round 1 scores for each side. **Both sides flip over their played Combo Cards, face-up**. A side's score is equal to the total value of all the *non-sideways* cards in their Combo Zones, times the Combo Multiplier (see the sidebar). You will keep a running total across all three rounds. Remember: sideways cards were used for Position/BGM Techs instead, and do not count toward this play combo.

Whoever has the highest score "Wins" the Round. If there's a tie (unlikely), draw off until someone has a higher (and discard those cards). Discard all cards from the play area, and move to Round 2.


##### (SIDEBAR: Building Combos)

Okay, so your real ultimate goal in each Round is to build the best damn hand of up to five cards that you can, using the cards available to your team. While Coach is limited to ONLY the cards in his Cache, he's got a lot of them, and he redraws every turn. Meanwhile, your team must use all the cards they have between them, and they don't get the same redraw options as Coach. In fact, the only draw-ups you get are at the start of the first Round, and through the applied use of the Heart's Position Tech.

Adding to that, you aren't allowed to actively discuss your Caches, either! On the plus side, by the time you've come to this point, you probably have a lot of good cards out in those Factions, and a few other tricks up your sleeves.

A solid strategy is to make strategic use of both the Heart's draw-up Tech and the Head's pass-over Tech to buff up the "leader's" Cache with good combo cards. Then let the Leader handle the actual Combo plays, unless your team has such a good real-world synergy that you can pull off good combos together with minimal communication.

The Combos you play directly multiply your end-of-Round score, so play well!

| Combo                   | Multiplier   |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| High Card               | x1           |
| 1 Pair                  | x10          |
| 2 Pair, 3-Straight      | x100         |
| 3-Kind, 4-flush         | x1,000       |
| 4-Straight              | x10,000      |
| 5-Flush                 | x100,000     |
| 4-Kind, 4-Straightflush | x1,000,000   |
| Full House              | x10,000,000  |
| 5-Straightflush         | x100,000,000 |

The combos are not in the same Poker order, this is intentional. Remember, you are potentially giving up valuable actions in order to just go for points, thus the more difficult 5-card combos are more valuable. That said, this definitely needs some testing!


#### Round Two: YOU CAN DO IT!

As Round 1, but:

**Draw-Up (Coach only):** Coach draws back up to full Cache (Escalation + Other) at the top, but the Pilots do *not*.

**First Play:** Whoever scored highest in the previous Round gets to choose if they want to play first, or instead force their opponent to play first.

**Combo Scores:** Combos scored at the end of the Round are worth DOUBLE (x2).


#### Round Three: FINISH IT!

As Round 2, but:

**Draw-Up (Coach only):** Coach draws back up to full Cache (Escalation + Other) at the top, but the Pilots do *not*.

**Combo Scores:** Combos scored at the end of Round 3 are worth TRIPLE (x3).

When Round 3 ends, the Rumble is over! And in the truly unlikely result of a tie, play one last round, winner takes all!


### Step 4: Determine Outcome

At the end of Round three: Whoever has the highest score across all three Rounds wins! Narrate the results, which are hopefully suitably epic.


#### Discard and Draw:

**Combo Zones:** Discard all cards in and around the Zones.

**Pilots:** Draw up / Discard down to max Cache.

**Coach:** Discard entire remaining Cache.


#### Scenario Final Score Modifications

Big wins or losses in a Rumble can affect the Pilots' Final Score in the scenario they are playing.

If the Pilots' total is **greater than or equal to** the monster's:

* Basic Success: They Just barely Survived (Final Scenario Score +X)
* 2X the Monster's Score or More: They won a Great Victory (Final Scenario Score +YY)
* 10X the Monster's score or more: They Stomped the Shit out of the Monster (Final Scenario Score +ZZZ)

However, if the monster's points were **greater than** the Pilots':

* Basic Loss: The monster forced their retreat (Final Scenario Score -X)
* 2X the Pilots' Score or More: The monster wrecked them (Final Scenario Score -YY)
* 10X the Pilots' Score or More: The Monsters obliterated the Pilots, and Humanity is on the brink of destruction... (Final Scenario Score -ZZZ)

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** The variables above will come as I finalize play flow and balance the math on the end-of-scenario scoring process.


## Extended Considerations: Locations

**Playtest Notes:** Just like the big mecha shows have the robos totally ruining the cities around them, that could be e thing here. +Ruin triggers should stack up and take away points as they lay waste to the Locations. Can they somehow prevent this?


## Rumble Final Thoughts

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** This whole sub section!

One thing I've considered is if personal Techs and such can be used inside Rumbles. It *seems* like a cool idea, but I've not even really begun toying with those ideas yet. It would certainly require some deeper consideration, and right now I just want to make sure the core idea works on the skeletal level before adding anything extra to it.
