# Basics of the Deck

(all the details on the basics of how the cards work)

The Deck is the singular tool for all forms of mechanics resolution in ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** In this Chapter, we break down the basics of how the cards are used during play.


## Card Placements

During the course of play, the cards will cycle between the following places in the game space:

(TBD: include diagram!)

* the **Deck** (from which you draw, face-down); 108 cards total, built by combining two standard 54-card Decks of playing cards.
* the **Pile** (where they are played, face-up); Piles are sent to the Trash after each conflict concludes.
* the **Trash** (where they are discarded, face-up); Trash is next to the main Deck.
* your **Stash** (which you hold during play, facing you); this is your personal ongoing and ever-changing hand of immediately-accessible playing cards.
* one or more **Factions** (as Favor, stacked face-down with topmost card face-up)
* the Robo Rumble **Combo Zones** (5 on each side; where the cards are played during the three rounds of Rumbles)
* certainly not your **Sleeve**, because that's cheating...
* and occasionally the **Floor**, where we all inevitably drop them from time to time!


### Deck

There is a single core **Deck** of 108 playing cards created by combining the cards from two identical 54-card Decks together. *All* of the players use the same combined Deck for their actions. The Deck is placed face-down in the middle for everyone to see. The four Jokers are always shuffled in face-*up*, however.


### Faction

**Factions** are sources of external power that the Pilots uncover through exploration and role-playing. When a Faction's favor has been acquired by the Pilots, they can invest cards from their Stash into that faction, keeping them on the table for later use. This allows well-connected Teams access to more card options beyond their rather limited personal Stashes. Factions and their uses are described in more detail on p. SQUARP.


### Pile

During Throwdowns, a **Pile** of cards temporarily exists in the middle of the table. Whenever a participant plays a card, they play it on top of the Pile, face-up. Long Throwdowns with many participants can create huge piles indeed.


### Stash

Your **Stash** is a collection of cards that you keep to yourself, hidden from the rest of the players. The majority of your Plays will come from this Stash, which frequently refreshes throughout a session. Only Pilots actively maintain their card Stashes between conflicts.

Your Max Stash allowance is set at a base of three (3) cards, but this can be modified by certain techs and gear. If a Pilot ever holds more cards than their Max at the end of a conflict, they must discard down to Max. Likewise, if they ever hold less than their Max at the end of a conflict, they must draw back up to Max.

Coach *does not* maintain an active Stash of cards between conflicts. He only draws a temporary Stash at the beginning of Throwdowns and Rumbles, and he discards/invests any remaining cards when those are completed. Outside of those conflicts, Coach's plays are always "blind."


### Trash

The Deck has an associated **Trash** heap, which is a stack of face-up cards next to it on the table. When a card that came from the Deck is discarded during play, it goes on top of the Trash heap, face-up.


### Combo Zone

When the Pilots combine to fight a Big Giant Monster, both sides have five play zones where they assemble their best "spreads" of cards against each other.


## Card Details

***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** uses standard playing cards, available just about everywhere. The assumptions are:

* Basic rectangular playing cards, 54 in total
* Each card has a front (or face) with a different rank and suit on it.
* Each card has a back with an identical pattern, making the cards indistinguishable when looked at from behind.


### Face, Faces, and Facing

If you're not used to playing cards, the terms "face" and "facing" and "face cards" can be a bit confusing. Hopefully the following can make some of that easier:

* Every card has a Face and a Back. The Face shows the rank and suit of the card, while the Back shows the standard card backing pattern for that deck.
* Some cards have *literal* faces on their faces, denoting them as Jacks, Queens, and Kings. While every card in the deck has a face, these cards are *specifically* called Face Cards. They have number values of 11, 12, and 13, respectively.
* Finally, the term "facing" is used to denote the directional positioning of the card in play. For example, if a card is laying on the table with it's "face" side directed downward, then it is noted as "facing" down, or simply "face-down."


### The Suits

The four card Suits are primarily used to break ties and empower certain actions in Throwdowns. Suit order is Spades (highest), Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (lowest). Each suit has an associated **Suit Value** which is used by a handful of side mechanics: Spades = 4, Hearts = 3, Diamonds = 2, and Clubs = 1.


### Number Cards

The Numbered cards are ranked by value, with Two (2) being the lowest and Ten (10) being the highest.

Also, note that Twos are considered somewhat important in that by default they are the only cards that beat Aces (see below).


### Face Cards

Jacks, Queens, and Kings are typically played as number cards with values of 11, 12, and 13, respectively. They are also sometimes used in special Techs and other situations, making them a bit more valuable in the common play.


### Aces

Ace cards have a special dual numerical nature, existing in one of two forms. When "Empowered" they have a functional value of 11, but when "Diminished" they have a functional value of 1.

Numerically, Aces beat any number card played *before* them in Throwdowns, as if they had an "Empowered" value of Eleven (11). In Gambits, they similarly have an effective value of 11. This makes them the highest-ranked card in Throwdown Initiatives and Plays.

However, when *followed* specifically by a Two (2) card, Aces are considered "Diminished" and have a value of One (1). So an Ace beats any card of ranks Two through Ten that comes before it in a Throwdown, but a Two played after an Ace beats it, starting the whole chain from the bottom again. This *only* applies to Twos that immediately follow the Ace in the Pile, and not to Threes or any higher card.

When a player uses any other game mechanic to randomly generate a number from a Card, an Ace is by default considered Diminished, providing a value of 1, unless another effect somehow Empowers it (giving it a value of 11).


### Jokers

Jokers are used as a special Pacing and Empowerment mechanic. The four Jokers are always shuffled into the combined Deck *face-up*. When a Joker is revealed (by reaching the top of the Deck), a few things happen. First off, *all* the Heroes currently at the table gain 1 Charge. Then Coach immediately takes the card and sets it face-up in front of him at the table as an **Omen**.

Omens in play exist in two states: Active (face-up) and Spent (face-down). Omens represent impending Doom for the Heroes. Rules for their management are found in Coach's section of this manual (see p. SQUARP), but in short, he can choose to Spend an Omen at any time by flipping it face-down. This triggers one of the pre-written Escalation Events for the current scenario.

Jokers are *never* sent to Play Piles or the Trash; Jokers on the table are not returned to the Deck until there are four Spent (as in *face-down*) Omens in front of Coach.


## Card Terminology


### Discard

When the rules call for a card to be **discarded**, you must remove the card in question from its current place in play and place it face-up on top of the Trash. If an effect tells you to Discard, the card in question bypasses all other play locations and goes directly onto the Trash. Discards never count toward Play Pile totals.


### Draw

When you are told to **draw** a card, take the top card of the Deck and put it in your current active Stash of cards. Sometimes you may be told to "draw and immediately play" - in this case, that card skips your Stash and is played directly to the table. Outside of that specification, when you draw a card, it goes into your Stash before any subsequent actions or plays follow.


### Flip

The mechanics sometimes instruct you to **flip** one or more cards. If it's a single card, just flip it in place so that whichever side was previously facing the table (or "down") is now facing away from the table (or "up"). So if you're told to flip a card that is "face up" on the table, flip it so it is now "face down" in the same place.

If you are told to flip a *stack* of cards, first tidy up the stack in place so that all the cards neatly align, and then flip the entire stack as a single unit, so that the card that was facing towards the table is now facing away from it. Do *not* flip each card individually.


### Play

When the rules tell you to **play** a card, you take a card from your Stash and place it on the table in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, all card plays are performed face-up.

Sometimes you may see the sub-terms **Play-up** and **Play-down** in the test. These mean "play a card face up" and "play a card face down," respectively. Similarly, if the rules say that you "play down" or "play up" a card, those signify the orientation of the to-be-played card. But to repeat: unless otherwise stated, *all* Plays are performed face-up.

If the rules call for a "**blind**" play, you must play that card directly from the top of the Deck. Pull the card and immediately play it. Remember: outside of active Throwdowns, all of Coach's plays are blind.


### Remove

*Very* occasionally the rules will call for a card to be **Removed from Play**. When this happens, take the card(s) in question and set them aside entirely. These cards do not go to Trash, and do not get reshuffled into the Deck. These cards remain out of play for the duration of the current session or scenario, whichever is specified by the effect at the time.


### Shuffle/Reshuffle

Whenever the rules call for a **Shuffle** or **Reshuffle**, Coach picks up the Deck and the Trash and then reshuffles them back together. Unless specific rules state otherwise, the following items are not typically reshuffled into the Deck during common reshuffles: Stashes, Factions, Omens, Piles, Zones, etc - in other words, any other card locations that are not specifically the Deck or the Trash.



# +Triggers: Microevents

Much of the game is driven by a number of small self-contained mechanical processes called **Microevents**. Microevents are implemented as quick scripted "system calls" activated by "**+Trigger**" notations as consequences of the natural flow of game play. As these fire-and-forget subroutines are frequently triggered via myriad different game components, all of the microevents are tagged and collected in this section as a way of quickly referencing them.

Think of microevents like quick side mechanics, or small subroutines in code. When fired, each one makes a minor tweak or modification here or there, and then shuts down. While each event is called at various times by other, larger, more complicated game mechanics, they are not solely subservient to or isolated components of those greater processes.

Each microevent detailed here is likely to be triggered in multiple places throughout the rest of this document. You don't need to memorize them on a first-read - instead, we collect them here for ease of future reference.

Ultimately there are two main categories of microevents: those that trigger actions, and those that cause "damage" to other components.


##### On +Trigger Notations

Microevent triggers are always given with the same basic notation. The full extended format is: **+Triggername:Target** with the first part declaring the microevent being triggered, and the second part stating the recipient of that event. If the trigger is given without the ":Target" suffix, then the target is either implicit in the event or simply not applicable. The breakdown of valid targets is as follows:

* **Self:** apply effect to instigator of the trigger
* **Opponent:** apply to instigator's active opponent
* **Choice:** apply to instigator's choice of valid recipient
* **Each**: apply to every valid target currently in play

Occasionally, you may see a specific "+Damage:Choice" in the rules, such as "Coach may trigger +Damage:Choice." This means that the instigator can apply any single damage-type trigger of their choice against any valid target.


##### Microevent List:

We've listed them here for quick convenient reference. These are all explained in greater detail further below.

**Actions**

* **+BREAK!** = action that allows Coach to disrupt a Lesser Fusion
* **+Burn** = action that forces as target to discard their current Stash
* **+Chargeup** = action that allows a Pilot to accrue a Charge
* **+Favor** = action that allows a Pilot to invest into a Faction
* **+Fortify** = action that allows a Pilot to recover a spent Buffer token
* **+Rally** = action that increases Team Harmony by one level
* **+Rebuild** = action that allows the Team to repair a damaged Location
* **+Restore** = action that allows a Pilot to recover a lost point of Commitment
* **+Replenish** = action that allows a Pilot to boost a Team Resource
* **+Storm** = action that allows Coach to activate a Storm
* **+Tarry** = action that causes a Deck Discard to simulate the passage of time
* **+Wave** = action that allows Coach to activate a Wave

**Damage:**

* **+Disfavor** = damage to a Faction
* **+Purge** = damage to a Pilot's Charge gauge
* **+Ruin** = damages to a Location
* **+Strife** = damage to the team Harmony gauge
* **+Trauma** = damage to a Pilot by directly reducing their Commitment stats


## Action Microevents


### +BREAK!

**Valid Targets:** Pilots in a Lesser Fusion

The heinous **+BREAK!** trigger allows Coach to disrupt an active Lesser Fusion.


### +Burn

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Coach

The **+Burn** trigger forces the target to discard their entire current Stash of cards.


### +Chargeup

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Chargeup** trigger allows a Pilot to add points to her Charge gauge. Unless otherwise specified, by default the event adds a single Charge. If her Charges are already full, this has no effect.


### +Favor

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Locations

The **+Favor** trigger allows the Team to invest cards into a revealed Faction. Unless otherwise specified, by default the event allows a single card investment to a single Faction of their choice.

Alternately, Coach may allow a Pilot to use a +Favor event to remove a Strike token from a relevant Faction.

See p. SQUARP for full details on Factions and Favor.


### +Fortify

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Fortify** trigger allows a Pilot to recover a single previously-spent Buffer token. If her Buffer is already at max, then this has no effect.


### +Rally

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Rally** trigger allows the Pilots to raise their Harmony rating by 1, to a maximum of 7 (Violet). If a +Rally trigger would raise the Harmony above 7, instead leave it at 7 and trigger +Chargeup:Each to the entire Team.


### +Rebuild

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Locations

The **+Rebuild** trigger allows the team to repair a Damaged location, returning it to a Standing state. This cannot be used on Standing or Razed Locations.


### +Recover

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Recover** trigger allows a Pilot to restore a single point of a temporarily-lowered Commitment. If her Commitments are undamaged, this has no effect. This does *not* restore permanent Commitment loss, such as that suffered from a Crisis State.


### +Replenish

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Resources

The **+Replenish** trigger allows the Pilots to add points to their Team Resources. Unless otherwise specified, by default the event increases a single Resource of their choice by +1. See p. SQUARP for full details on Team Resources.


### +Storm

**Valid Targets:** Coach (self)

The **+Storm** trigger allows Coach to activate any one Storm action on his scenario Threats. This can and likely will trigger other microevents. See p. SQUARP for full details on Waves and Storms.


### +Tarry

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Coach (self)

The game's time and escalation mechanics will occasionally call for a **+Tarry** action, most commonly when the Pilots make use of certain Location boons, but also occasionally when they waste time arguing and Coach feels necessary to mechanically nudge them into action.

Tarry is a quick and simple Coach-specific card action. When triggered, Coach takes a number of cards from the top of the Deck equal to the number of face-up Omens currently in play, and sends them directly to the Trash. This risks bringing the Deck ever closer to the revelation of another Omen (and potential escalation!).


### +Wave

**Valid Targets:** Coach (self)

The **+Wave** trigger allows Coach to activate any one Wave action on his scenario Threats. This can and likely will trigger other microevents. See p. SQUARP for full details on Waves and Storms.


## Damaging Microevents

(usually have a target stated; can usually be mitigated with Buffer tokens, within limits; etc)


##### Payloads: On "Stacking" Damage

(**PLAYTEST NOTE:** I feel this may need further clarification, but we'll see)

During "Open Play" of the game, damage-type +Triggers are usually resolved immediately upon their activation. Unless otherwise noted, all damage-type +Triggers "stack" when multiple instances accrue at the same time. Multiple simultaneous +Triggers is very rare in Open Play, but there are chances they might occur due to multiple Pilots triggering them simultaneously. When a number of identical damage triggers fire off at once, they must then all be resolved at once as well, in the order they were triggered. If there is no clear order, resolve them in the order the Team sees fit.

During Throwdowns, however, damage-type +Triggers are instead added to each side's relevant growing **Payload** stacks, to be applied altogether at the end of the conflict. The exceptions to this are a rare few abilities which specifically state that their effects are **immediate**. In these cases, resolve the +Triggers at the moment they occur, and do not add them to the Payloads.


### +Disfavor

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Factions

The **+Disfavor** trigger targets a revealed Faction, adding a single Strike token to that Faction's card. When a Faction reaches the third Strike, it is either removed from play or converted into a Threat (Coach's choice). See p. SQUARP for full details on Factions and Strikes.

By default, the team can spend points from the Fan Club to mitigate +Disfavor events, one token per event prevented.


### +Purge

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Purge** trigger targets a Pilot, forcing them to erase their current buildup of Charges.

By default, any Pilot can spend her Buffers to prevent a +Purge that targets her, one token per event prevented.


### +Ruin

**Valid Targets:** Locations

The **+Ruin** trigger targets a Location, and its effect depends on that Location's current state. If the Location is currently Standing, +Ruin forces it to flip to a Damaged state. If the Location is already Damaged, +Ruin forces it to a Razed state. A Razed location cannot be targeted by +Ruin.


### +Strife

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Strife** trigger hurts the Pilots by damaging their central team Harmony. Each time anyone in the team either triggers on their own or is otherwise afflicted with +Strife, the Team's Harmony is reduced by 1 rank. Harmony can never be reduced below 1 (Red); each instance of +Strife acquired while "in the Red" subsequently triggers +Trauma:Each to the *entire* team. See p. SQUARP for full details on Harmony.

By default, any Pilot can spend her Buffers to prevent +Strife that she personally either triggers or is targeted by, one token per event prevented.


### +Trauma

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Threats

The **+Trauma** trigger is the primary method for applying direct damage to both Pilots and Threats.

**Pilots:** Against Pilots, it damages them by temporarily lowering their Commitments. Each time a Pilot suffers +Trauma, she must temporarily reduce a Commitment rank of her choosing by 1 point. Commitments cannot be reduced below Zero (0) ranks, and when all of her Commitments are at Zero she enters Crisis Mode. See p. SQUARP for full details on Commitments and Crisis Modes.

**Threats:** Against Threats, this trigger directly lowers the enemy's Threat Rating. If a Threat's Rating is reduced to Zero (0), it is defeated and removed from play.

**Both:** Pilot and Threats can spend Buffer tokens to prevent +Trauma that targets or affects them, at a cost of one token per point of Commitment or Threat reduction prevented.


# Conflict Type 1: Fiat ("Just say what happens")

Now that you've read all about the nuances of using the cards, here's how to completely ignore them! You see, not every conflict needs to involve the cards, Strike Ranges, +Triggers, or any other mechanics. If there's a conflict at hand and you (any of you) think that you can get away with it, make a pitch to just say what happens and move on. This applies to all players, Pilots and Coach alike. If either side feels that an action taken by the other should be contested, they should say so of course and bring out the cards. But otherwise just keep role-playing and push forward with the scene, no cards required.

In fact, as a Pilot it's generally a good idea to keep this approach in your mind at all times. Instead of always *asking* Coach if you *can* do something, just tell him what you're *going to* do, and even how you want it to go down. If Coach feels that your actions are contested enough to require card play, then he'll tell you as such, otherwise he'll let it slide and you get the results you were seeking - or he may instead offer you a modified version of that, or even casually negotiate it with you. In other words, you are encouraged to take the initiative and actively push your Pilots' personal and team story agendas, and not worry about asking permission for every single action you wish to take. Try it out - you may be pleased with the results!



# Conflict Type 2: The Gambit

But now let's get back to the card-talk! The **Gambit** is the simplest (and likely the most common) card-based conflict in the game. Understanding the Gambit is foundational to understanding the flow of the entire rest of the game's mechanics.

Gambits tend to fall into two general uses during play: uncontested feats of the Pilots' abilities, and isolated, one-off micro-conflicts where Coach feels that the Pilot's attempt at action may cause interesting and unforeseen story repercussions. These are typically triggered when a player wants to do something challenging, but not necessarily worthy of a full-blown Throwdown - in other words, when the outcome of an event is uncertain, but Coach doesn't feel it necessary to involve the time or effort of a full round-table conflict process.

Gambits are meant to be very quick in play, and use the following structure:

1. Initiation
2. Play
3. Outcome

In short, Coach issues the challenge for a Gambit. The pilot accepts by playing *or* flipping a card, with the ultimate goal of beating a secret card played by Coach.


## Initiation

**To initiate a Gambit,** Coach states some variant of "that action's going to require a Gambit," or "that's a good question, we should Gambit to find out," letting the Pilot know that if she pushes forward with her plan, cards are going to be involved. The Pilot should then consider whether or not she wants to take that risk. The choice is *always* the Pilot's - in other words, Coach can never force a Gambit upon a Pilot.


## Play

Should the Pilot accept the challenge, Coach then flips a card from the Deck, laying it face-down on the table between himself and the Pilot. The value of this card will set the Threshold for the Gambit, but the Pilot does not know what it is before she plays.

The Pilot must then either play-up a card of her choice from her own Stash (or a visible Faction), or instead flip one from the top of the Deck (if she's feeling lucky or doesn't want to waste her cards). Her goal is to equal or exceed the still-unknown Threshold that Coach's card created.


## Outcome

Once the Pilot makes her play, Coach reveals the Threshold card. Compare the Pilot's Play to the Threshold, with final results as follows:

If **the Pilot's card is *higher*,** then the player achieves a **"Yes, and..."** result. The Pilot succeeds at the intended task, and gets to narrate some additional boon as well!

**In any other outcome,** the Pilot gets to choose one of the following three options:

* **Yes, but...**
* **No, but...**
* **No, *and*...** (+Chargeup)

With this outcome, your success or failure will always be accompanied by some kind of different side effect.

The extended details are below. Once the cards are revealed and the outcome is determined, the Gambit is complete. Discard the cards and move on with play.


### "Yes, and..."

With a "Yes, and..." result, the Pilot has gone beyond what was needed, and attained unexpected rewards for her gamble with fate. The Pilot's immediate goal is attained, and Coach additionally decides on a bonus "consequence" to the action. This should be some kind of helpful or otherwise positive boon to their situation. Positive Consequence examples:

* A beneficial narrative effect, such as a new clue, a newly-revealed ally, or the discovery of some new avenue to attain a personal goal.
* The Pilot can trigger a single-point positive trigger to herself or a relevant target involved in the scope of the Gambit: +Chargeup, +Favor, +Fortify, +Rebuild, +Recover, or +Replenish (others require more effort that a single Gambit, however)


### "Yes/No, but..."

"Yes, but..." and "No, but..." results represent unexpected consequences to the Pilot's actions. The former indicates that they attained their goal but suffer a negative consequence. The latter indicates that the Pilot has failed at their task, but gained another unexpected positive consequence instead (see the options above). Similar to "Yes, and..." results, in either case the bonus consequences should be "lesser" in nature, and not total game-changers. Negative Consequence examples:

* A deleterious narrative effect, such as in-story setbacks to the Pilot's goals, possessions, or immediate safety.
* One of Coach's Threats activates a Wave
* Coach triggers one of the following damaging events: +Disfavor, +Purge, +Strife


### "No, *and*..."

The third and final choice of a "failed" Gambit attempt may seem like an unusual one. By choosing a "No, and..." outcome, you not only fail to accomplish the goal at hand, but you *also* suffer some other negative side effect as well (see examples above). This is an *entirely* voluntary choice, letting any player who so chooses suffer double-defeat.

Why in humanity would a Pilot ever choose this option? Well, there is one speck of silver lining in this otherwise dismal cloud of failure: **When you choose the "No, and..." outcome, you also immediately activate +Chargeup:Self.** By choosing a deeper failure state, you at least gain some power from it as consolation, so it's not all bad!


### Playbook Gambit Specialties

Each Playbook has her own unique "Gambit Specialty" role-playing trigger. Whenever this specialty is involved in a Gambit, the player always gets a *second* "and" in their outcome, which adds an additional consequential effect of the same type already chosen. This always results in either two positives, or two negatives. It breaks down as follows:

1. "Yes, and (something positive), *and* (something else positive)."
2. "Yes, but (something negative), *and* (something else negative)."
3. "No, but (something positive), *and* (something else positive)."
4. "No, and (something negative), *and* (something else negative)." **Special:** In addition to the bonus +Chargeup already triggered by this choice, when a Specialty is involved the Pilot *also* gets to record a new Lesson.

**Please take note: *This isn't optional*.** If a Pilot's specialty is involved, she *must* include the additional "and" effect.


## Strike Ranges in Gambits

Strike Range is a mechanic that has been mentioned before but not yet fully introduced as of this point in the book. Greater details on this mechanic are found on p. SQUARP. For now, this note exists only to clarify a major point: Strike Ranges *do not* apply to Gambits. If ever you have any questions about that, refer back to this section for written proof.



# Conflict Type 3: The Throwdown

A Throwdown is played out to resolve any in-game conflict that has larger stakes than those a Gambit would cover. Usually this involves active opposition from one or more Threats against the Pilots, but there are other situations where a Throwdown will make more sense than a simple Gambit. Basically any time there are big stakes in play, and you want to get tensions running deeper, play a Throwdown.

Examples of when to Throw Down:

* The Pilots are trying to break into a secure bunker while a team of anthrosaur minions is clawing at them.
* The Pilots are trying to convince an unflinchingly stubborn planetary governor to give them aid.
* The Pilots are trying to cross the Great Spectral Sea unharmed while a void storm rages against them.


### TL;DR Version

(**Playtest Note:** keep revisiting this to make sure it's up to date across revisions)

You wanna rough this jerk up and teach him not to mess with you and your sisters anymore. So you throw down a card and say "Dude, I'm gonna break your face!" And he downs down a card of his own and says "Bring it, bitch! I'm gonna humiliate the shit outta you in front of the whole school" Clearly, blood and bruises are on the line, so you're gonna have to work hard not to take damage.

You both flip cards and yours is higher, but shit, it's like WAY higher than his, outside of your Strike Range and then some, so you'll trigger a +Strife event when this is all done (this shit had better be worth it). Anyway, you think you got him where you want him, when he throws down a better card and kicks you square in the ribs, so hard you think they're cracking. You then thrown down your own card in response and grab his leg, pulling it down *hard* and snapping a bone. Not just that, though - you threw in your ***Gai Kee Gan Flare!*** and took it to the limit (delivering painful Trauma to your foe), almost ripping the asshat's leg right out of the socket! But your card was too high again, and that means a second +Strife event - this could be extra painful!

He relents. There are four cards in the final Pile, and you put them all toward hitting this jackass with as much Trauma as you can. He crawls back to his dorm, crying the whole way. Thankfully he was just some pissant bully with no common sense and no real strength to back it up. The Trauma you took in the process was easy enough to soak by your Buffer, you're a tough gal and this was barely a fight worth remembering. But those +Strife triggers are gonna hurt your team's Harmony, because you just *know* the team is gonna be pissed at you for going off on your own and getting in another fight...


## Basic Concepts


### Goal


**The Goal of a Throwdown:** To win a Throwdown, you need to have the highest card on top of the Pile when the last action is played (i.e. after the last participant Folds). And if you want to "win big" and get the most results from your effort, you want there to be a lot of cards in that Play Pile when you do eventually win.


### Payloads: Damage Accumulation

Throwdowns exist as contained microcosms of action focused on living in the moment of high-energy, bad-ass action. Unlike open play, wherein all +Trigger events are usually resolved immediately upon triggering, in Throwdowns they instead pile up on the sidelines, building what are called **Paylods** on each side of the conflict. Payloads are not "delivered"" until the last participant Folds and the outcome of the sequence is finally determined. At that point, they are all applied at once, and in really long conflicts the results can be quite intense!

To manage this in play, whenever +Trigger events would occur (for example, when using the Hammer's base power), just tally them as part of your side's growing Payload and move on with the flow. They'll be totaled at the end of the sequence and applied to your opponent in one big chunk. We recommend the use of colored token counters for ease of visual reference.

**Payloads are applied regardless of the victor.** Any Payload that your side builds up during a Throwdown will be applied to your opponent at the conclusion, regardless of who wins the final Pile. While the Pile itself is usually the "main prize" of the event, Payloads represent effects generated as a consequence of the process, and ensure that there are very few "clean sweep" victories in this game.


### Strike Range

This has been mentioned a few times already in the text, and now we're finally going to explain what it means. One of the most crucial things to remember when playing cards in a Throwdown is your Pilot's **Strike Range**. This number is initially based on her Commitment to the Fight, and modified by a number of other Techs and abilities.

When you use a **Push Action** in a Throwdown, you want to play a card that is higher than the card currently on top of the Play Pile. The lower the *difference* between the two cards, the better the play. For example, a Three (3) played on top of a Two (2) has a difference of 1, while a Nine (9) played on top of a Two has a difference of 7.

If your card's difference is *within* your Strike Range, your Push carries true, and that's all you need to worry about. However, if your card's difference is *greater than* your Strike Range, then your action still carries true, but you also trigger +Strife as your action hits too hard, uses dishonorable tactics, or otherwise falls outside of the rules of your team.

In this manner, playing high can most likely achieve your objectives sooner, but playing *too* high can hurt your Harmony. The strategy lies in playing the right card at the right time.

**Coach:** Your Threats have their own rules for Strike Range. Your Threats' base Strike Ranges are set by their *combined* Threat Ratings. Unlike the Pilots, your Threats are hard-bound to their Strike Ranges, and cannot exceed them unless they have special Powers allowing such action. Since your Initiative is Blind, you ignore Strike Range when Challenging or Accepting. See Threats, p. SQUARP.

**BLAH INCLUDE EXAMPLE TEXT OF STRIKE RANGE**


## Basic Flow

Someone kicks things off by issuing a challenge to action, and then anyone who wants in plays initiative. Once a winner is determined, a quick round of initial card-drawing happens, and then the action starts.

The players go leftwards (clockwise) around the table consecutively one-upping each other with grander, zanier, more dramatic, more intense, and more descriptive narration of action. Those narrations are accompanied by special powers and involve playing cards onto a central Play Pile.

On the one hand, this is definitely *a Process* that needs to be learned and mastered. On the other hand, it's pretty darn fun, and you really only need to play it once to figure it out. There are probably more words here than are really needed to get it down, but there are a lot of side questions that I chose to answer in the flow, primarily to provide clarity into the *why* of things.

Flow Table:

1. Initiate with simultaneous cards
2. Establish the Scope
3. Draw Bonus Cards
4. Take Turns and Actions until everyone Folds
5. Determine Outcome


## Step 1. Initiate the Throwdown

To challenge another player to a Throwdown, the procedure is as follows, with minor differences for pilots and Coach.


### Throwing the Gauntlet

**Pilots:** To initiate a Challenge, play (or even *slam!*) down a card on the table in front of you, adding immediate declaration of Challenge (Bring it, It's on, Come and Get me, Let's do this, etc). Narrate what your pilot is doing to start the action, and set your Stakes (see sidebar). **Do not** draw back up yet.

**Coach:** To initiate a Challenge, take the top card of the Coach Deck and play it down. Narrate how your Threat is moving against the pilots, and set your Stakes.

Once you've initiated, you are now the "Challenger" for the rules that follow.


##### (Stakes Sidebar)

> Stakes are a simple statement of what you want to happen when you win the Throwdown. They need to be single-subject, concise, and focused in scope. They should also be feasibly realistic, of course. "I'm going to Kill the Lord Governor, activate the explosive, rescue the captives, escape the planet, and win the game!" is definitely *bad* form. Zoom them in on the more immediate, such as "I'm going to beat up the Lord Governor!" or "I'm going to activate the explosive!" and let the other things emerge in different conflicts, or even freely through narrative play.
>
> They also can't override mechanics. "I'm going to kill this bitch!" isn't valid (although is is nicely emotive), because it likely requires a tangible application of the +Trauma trigger, which isn't always guaranteed even when you've won. Something like "I'm doing to beat that bitch down!" is a more acceptable statement that clearly implies an immediately-achievable narrative intent. **Coach has the final say on whether certain stakes are acceptable, or even possible.**
>
> Stakes are also the narrative method for declaring the basic premise of what the whole conflict is about in the first place. Stakes that focus on politics and trade will create a vastly different feel than those focused on violence and combat.


### Accepting the Challenge

With the gauntlet thrown, the others at the table must now choose if they're involved. Starting with the player sitting to the Challenger's Left, and proceeding clockwise around the table, each player with an in-scene character (or Threat) must choose if they are going to accept the challenge, join in to assist either side, or sit this one out and watch (or cheer).

**Pilots:** To accept a challenge, likewise play down a card and add your narrative flair in response (Oh yeah? That the best you got? You want summa this? You don't know what you're messing with!). Narrate your action, and set your own counter-stakes.

Multiple pilots may work together if they wish. The process is the same as accepting. They must set stakes as well, but are allowed to simply parrot other Pilots' stakes if they're working together.

**Coach:** To accept a player-initiated challenge, take the top card of the Coach Deck and play it down. Likewise narrate your Threat's response to (and acceptance of) the challenge.


### Refusing the Challenge

If you initiate a challenge and no one steps up to it, then your goals (aka the Stakes you set) are achieved without conflict. This is a fairly simple concept: if someone moves against you, and you relent, then they get exactly what they want. Consider this next time someone challenges you.

Mechanically, this means you reveal all currently-played cards from the Initiation and then skip on ahead to the Outcome step, using those cards as your final winning Play Pile.


### Teaming Up

Teaming up is simply done by allies "accepting" the challenge and joining your side. See "Accepting the Challenge," above.


### Winning Initiative and Starting Play Pile

To determine the winner of the challenge, flip all the played cards face-up, then stack them face-up in numerical order, with the lowest on the bottom. This creates the initial **Play Pile**. At this point, the only cards that matter are the one on the top and the one directly beneath it.

If your card is on top, then you are the winning Challenger and also the current leader of the Throwdown (and if no one else plays afterward, you win the whole conflict!).

**Pilots:** If you're on top, compare the value of your winning card to the one beneath it. If the difference is within your Strike Range, you're all set. If it's outside your Range, your play still holds true but you inadvertently damaged the team spirit, adding +Strife to your incoming Payload.

**Coach:** Since Coach plays Initiative Blind, If his card is on top, do not check for Strike Range.

**PLAYTEST:** I'm considering changing this so that there's a chance Coach's threats take damage from this. Might be too complicated though.


### Initiative Card Strategy

**Pilots:** The base strategy when choosing your initiative card is hoping yours will beat all the others, *and* that the next-highest card will be just within your character's Strike Range. Pilots working together may find it useful to try and play lower cards to give the "leader" of the fight a better chance of padding out their Strike Range. Contrarily, either side may choose to "fake out" their opponent and play as low a card as possible, with the hopes that their opponent played high and will thus suffer from playing outside Range. Remember that Coach's initiative is totally random, so it can be harder to plan against.

**Coach:** Since your Initiative is always Blind, you have no strategy to consider here, unless your specific Threats denote otherwise.


## Step 2. Establish the Scope

Before getting into the actual card-play, you need to establish the scope of this fight. Chances are this is already established by situation and the declared Stakes, but it's important to consider either way.

When and where is this taking place? Is this a heated argument in the Debate Club room? A dangerous battle on the tar plains of Aegilius VII? A stealthy infiltration job in the enemy's server core? A high-NRG round of competitive love-making? This system covers all of these and more. It's just a matter of making sure everyone's on the same page with the who, what, when, and where.

**Identifying the Location** is primarily important for Location Boons and the application of potential +Ruin triggers. But the scope will also definitely affect the flavor of all action narration, so make sure everyone is on the same page as to where you are and what the focus of the fight is.

**This is also when you state if the Robos are already present and involved.** If it's just the Pilots outside of their robos, it's important for everyone to know, as it will restrict use of Robo Techs and boons. Don't worry: if it makes sense to summon them mid-fight, there's an action for that.


## Step 3. Draw Bonus Cards

Each side now draws additional bonus cards into their Stashes from the Deck. Start with the initiative Victor, draw up as directed, and then move to the left.

**Pilots:** *Draw* a number of bonus cards based on your **Commitment to the Team** stat, and add them directly to your Stash. Some Gear or character effects may directly alter your draw amount, as well.

**Coach:** Draw one card for each Pilot opposing you, plus additional cards = the combined Threat Ratings of your present and involved opponents.


## Step 4. Turns and Actions (The Round)

With the challenge victor determined, play now begins with the player to the victor's left. Play moves clockwise around the table, with each participant playing cards and taking one or more actions. Play concludes when the last participant has the highest card on top and everyone else has Folded.

There are two Types of Actions: **Main** actions and **Side** actions. On your turn you can (and must) only take one Main action, but you can take any number of Side actions *before* taking your main action. You can perform any number of Side actions, but **you can't perform the same Side action twice in the same turn**. Additionally, you will likely have a good number of Side Actions available to you, but you don't necessarily need to play all of them, and probably shouldn't.

Once you have chosen and performed a Main Action on your turn, it becomes the turn of the next involved player in the turn order. Initial turn order in every new Throwdown is clockwise around the table (aka move to the left), but this can change mid-conflict.

Proceed in this order until all but one participant has Folded, then move to the Outcome step.

The actions in the subsections below are listed with which Type of action they are (Main/Side) and which players can use them (Pilots/Coach/Both).


##### (Actions Reference Sidebar)

**Main Actions:**

* **Assist:** Discard a card, and give either range or card bonus to an ally
* **Beat-Back:** Play a same-ranked card as is on top, flipping both over and under
* **Fold:** lay Stash face-down and concede
* **LET'S RUMBLE!:** Combine Robos and fight a Big Giant Monster!
* **Push:** play a higher card, narrate

**Side Actions:**

* **Activate Gear:** Use a piece of Gear and draw a few extra cards
* **FUSION!:** Activate or Dissolve a Lesser Fusion sequence with the other Pilots
* **Invoke Faction:** Draw the top Favor card from a Faction into your Stash
* **Recharge:** Discard a card in order to gain more Charges
* **Sacrifice Gear:** Destroy a piece of Gear to activate its sacrifice effect
* **Summon Robo:** bring in your personal Robo if it isn't already involved
* **Trigger Wave/Storm:** Coach activates a Wave or Storm of an involved Threat


##### (Special Actions Sidebar)

> Depending on your Techs, Gear, or other resources, you may have other unique Main or Side actions available to you on your turn. When in question, the specific Action descriptions override normal action flow rules. Keep aware of your character's abilities to make sure you always know if these options are open to you on your turn.
>
> Some special actions require the discard of one or more cards from your Stash in order to activate. In these cases, the cards always go directly to the Trash, skipping the Play Pile entirely.


##### ("You May Not Pass" Sidebar)

> You may have noticed that there is no default "pass" or similar option, and this is intentional. If you're going to join a Throwdown, then you're going to ***Throw Down*** or you have no reason being there.


### Main Actions

On your turn, you *must* do one - and *only* one - Main Action.


#### Assist (Main, Pilots)

The **Assist** action is actually two actions, each with a very similar activation but different results: one lets you pass a card to an ally, while another lets you increase an ally's play Range.

The **Card-Assist** action allows you to pass a card to the next ally in the Throwdown. To do this, you must first pick any single card (doesn't matter what) from your Stash and discard it (which means that it does *not* go into the pile). Then pick a *different* card from your Stash and pass it to the next ally in the current rotation. That ally then adds that card directly to their Stash.

The **Strike-Assist** action allows you to boost your next ally's Strike Range. To do this, you must likewise first pick a card from your Stash and discard it. The next ally to take a turn receives a Strike Range modifier determined by your Team's current Harmony. Note that it rarely makes sense for a pilot "in the Red" to Strike-Assist, since they provide a negative modifier, but there may be some fringe cases where it can be desirable.

In both cases, it is definitely possible to chain your assists together! If you just received an Assist from your ally, you can then pass it on again to your *next* ally, should there be more of you in the Throwdown. Likewise, you must also discard a card from your Stash. If the Assist is card-based, you now pass *two* cards to your next ally - the one you were originally passed, plus another from your own Stash. If the Assist is Strike-based, then your own Assist score is added to the mix as well, and as such your next ally gets the combined bonuses! You can even combine Card and Strike Assists together in a big round-table combo chain.

An assist-chain like this ends when the next recipient in the ongoing Chain does not use the Assist action on her turn.


#### Beat-Back (Main, Both)

A **Beat-Back** action happens when you play a card that is of the same rank and of an equal or higher suit as the highest card on the Pile. In this case, both cards are flipped face-down and placed on the very bottom of the Pile. The card beneath the previous one should now be on top.

The Beat-Back action essentially lets you re-write the narrative of the last-played Push. Narration of a Beat-Back should involve the clear turning of the tide, albeit temporarily. The enemy has been pushed back down the chain of action, possibly even negating their last narration. Clearly then, it's not really a good idea to play a Beat-Back when one of your allies' cards is the one on top, unless you *really* know what you're doing. Not only is it rude, but it actively works against you and your team.

Why Beat-Back at all? It keeps you in the action if it's all you can play, and it also pushes the top card down to a lower value. This can possibly give your side more play options if all you have left are lower cards. It can also restrict your enemy's play options if they only have *higher* cards, forcing them to risk playing out of Strike Range if they want to keep Pushing - and against some Threats, it might even prevent them from being able to play at all!


#### Fold (Main, Both)

To **Fold** you take your currently-active Stash and place it on the table in front of you, face-down. This signifies that you are either out of options, or otherwise no longer wish to push the conflict. You are now out of the Throwdown, you can take no more Actions of any type, and you are no longer factored into the turn rotation. Note that if you're out of cards and have no other special actions available to you, you **must** Fold. A Throwdown doesn't end until _everyone_ has Folded.

Choosing to Fold *does not* nullify any effects you may have activated from playing Side Actions on the same turn. This means that yes, on your final turn you can choose take as many Side Actions as you have at your disposal and then immediately Fold - that's not just allowed, it's *encouraged* as a valid strategy!

**Do not Discard your Stash just yet!** Discards will be handled at the end.


#### LET'S RUMBLE! (Main, Both)

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** This is still being considered. I might scrap the mid-Throwdown initiation entirely, and require that it only initiate outside of an active conflict.

The **LET'S RUMBLE!** Main action is a special trigger that stops the current Throwdown in its tracks and escalates the action to a Giant Monster sized scale. When triggered, a number of complicated things happen that are described in greater detail in the "Rumble* chapter further on.

Any side of a Throwdown can initiate a Rumble, using the rules outlined in the extended Rumbles chapter, further on. When either side initiates a Rumble, they *must* do so in a dramatic way, calling out their side's custom battle cry or monster name aloud.


#### Push (Main, Both)

The **Push** is the primary and most common action of a Throwdown. It's how immediate actions and agendas get advanced, and how valuable Pile cards build up to increase the final outcome. When you Push, you play a card face-up on top of the pile. You can play either from your own Stash, or instead from any available sources of external power (Factions for Pilots, and some Threats have extra cards that Coach can use). That card must *beat* the card currently on top, using the standard core card ranking rules of the game. Even if the last-played card is your ally's, you still *must* beat it, otherwise you can't Push.

When you Push, you must narrate how you are pushing the action. You *must* provide verbal statement of action, counter-action, or other such direct involvement in the moment that changes the course of the fight. This narration is up to you, and should involve your own direct action against your opponent. Use this opportunity to shout out your actions and describe cool new power attacks! Go wild!

Seriously, this is one of the main points in which you get to add all the awesome genre-inspired descriptive flavor that brought you to this game in the first place. Tell us what your Push looks like, and be creative! For example:

* Launch a volley of missiles at the enemy!
* Summon your inner fury and deliver a mega-dragon-uppercut!
* Take twelve of the bad guys down with a super sweet power slide!
* Transform your cyborg legs into tank treads and roll across the field blasting lasers!

**Pilots:** Remember your Strike Ranges! When you Push, you want your card to beat your opponent's by a difference no greater than your Strike Range. You can play any card you like, but if the difference is greater than your Strike then you will add +Strife to your incoming Payload.


### Side Actions


#### Activate Gear (Side, Both)

You can **Activate** a piece of carried Gear as a side action. Doing so usually gives you that Gear's card draw bonus, letting you immediately draw that many cards into your Stash. Some Gear may have special alternate Activation effects, so check your Gearlist to be sure.

Any single piece of Gear may only be activated once per Throwdown.


#### FUSION! (Side, Pilots)

If you are currently un-Fuzed, this initiates a Lesser Fusion with one or more Pilots. If they accept and you meet the requirements, you all join your Charges, Techs, and Cards into one combined meta-character. The other Pilots are removed from the rotation temporarily, instead sharing the same combined hand with you on your turn. You still only get one Main Action per turn, but with a greater array of power at your disposal.

If used while Fuzed, this action instead breaks the existing Fusion. After resolving the breakup, it is still your turn.

Fusion rules are detailed in significantly more depth on p. SQUARP.


#### Invoke Faction (Side, Both)

You declare how a single given in-play Faction is helping you, and then draw the face-up Favor card from that Faction into your Stash. If one is face-down beneath it afterward, flip it over to replace it on the Faction's stack. While normally you can just play cards directly from a Faction, this can be useful to bolster your hand for Discards, Assists, and other future actions.

If Coach somehow has any Factions under his control, he can use this action as well on his turn.


#### Recharge (Side, Pilots)

This side action allows you to boost your current Charges by discarding from your Stash. When you declare this action, you must discard a single card from your currently-held Stash. This triggers +Chargeup, with the value of Charges gained determined by the Suit Value of the discarded card.


#### Sacrifice Gear (Side, Both)

Instead of Activating a piece of Gear, you can ***Sacrifice*** it by destroying it in a sufficiently cool and useful way. This grants you the effect of that Gear's sacrifice effect, but also permanently destroys it.

You cannot both Activate and then Sacrifice the same piece of Gear in the same Throwdown.


#### Summon Robo (Side, Pilots)

If your Robo isn't currently involved in the Throwdown, and the situation makes enough narrative sense that it *could* be, you can use the **Summon Robo** Side action to call it into play. This results in a really short dramatic description of how your Robo enters the scene, and is largely based on the way your group has flavored that aspect of your World.

However the narrative method of Robo-summoning may be described, it is usually accompanied by an additional mechanical effect as described in your Playbook.


#### Trigger Wave/Storm (Side, Coach)

The **Trigger Wave/Storm** side action allows Coach to use the Waves and/or Storms of any of his involved Threats. To Trigger a Wave, Coach must discard a single Face card from his Stash. To Trigger a Storm, Coach must discard *three* Face cards.

Triggering each individual Wave and/or Storm is considered a separate action, meaning Coach can trigger more than one in a turn, but cannot trigger the *same* Wave or Storm more than once in the same turn. If is it Coach's turn and he has a Stash full of face cards but no feasible strategy, it is entirely legal for him to blow them all triggering Waves and Storms before ultimately ending the conflict by Folding.


## Step 5. Resolution and Conclusion

Play continues until all opponents have Folded and there is no longer any viable opposition to the top-most card. Whoever's card is on top at the end ultimately wins the Throwdown.


### First, the Stakes

When you win, your initial narrative stakes are achieved.


### Second, Tally Payloads

Next, total the +Trigger Payloads tallied up on each side of the conflict, if any. Payloads are not Victory-dependent - meaning that all Payloads built up during a conflict are applied, regardless of the victor.

Tally them up on each side, but don't apply them yet.


### Third, Spend the Spoils

Then, the Victor can "spend" cards from the final play Pile to both build up their own Payload and mitigate their opponent's.

Start by separating the cards in the final Pile into Suit sets. Each card can then be "spent" by discarding it and stating what it does. Not every card has to be spent! Apply the effects you want, and then discard the rest.

The suit-based effects are as follows:

**Clubs** can be spent to add +Trauma events to the victor's final Payload. If the winning side featured either Robos or BGM Threats, they can instead be spent to add +Ruin events, as well.

**Diamonds** can be spent to remove any incoming damage-type +Triggers from the opponent's Payload, including +Strife events earned by the team. These cancel each other out one for one.

**Hearts** can be spent to restore spent Buffer tokens for members of the winning side of the conflict, one for one. Additionally, should the initial focus of the conflict have been on either gaining or restoring favor with a faction or repairing a damaged location, Hearts can be spent to add +Favor or +Rebuild events to the Payload.

**Spades**, however, are double-edged. Spades can be spent as if they were any of the other three suits. However, each spade thus spent gives the loser(s) of the conflict the option to similarly add an effect of their own choosing to their own Payload in return, as a concession to victory.

(**PLAYTEST:** As an alternative, I'm considering Spades *only* being a boon for the loser of the Throwdown. Meaning, the victor doesn't spent them at all, only the Loser. We'll see!)


### Fourth, Apply the Payloads

With the Pile spent and discarded, it's time to apply the Payloads. Each side first resolves all incoming damage +Triggers from their opponent's Payload, assigning the damage as they see fit to their valid targets. The leader of each side determines how any damage is assigned, and targets receiving damage can likewise use Buffers and Robo Trauma-Shifting against their own damage, when applicable. Note that +Strife triggers from acting outside of Strike can only be blocked by the Pilot who caused them (Pink is an exception to this).

Then resolve all remaining +Triggers in respective Payloads as each side sees fit.


### Fifth, Drop and Draw

With the Payloads resolved, it's time to drop and draw.

**Pilots** with more cards in their Stash than Max need to discard down to Max. Conversely, those with fewer cards than Max get to draw back up.

**Coach** immediately discards his entire Stash, and does not draw anything to replace it.


### Finally, Narrate the Results

(BLAH: victor tells us what happened; throwdown over; back to open play; etc)


## Throwdown Aftermath

(BLAH: only one throwdown per conflict until the circumstances change! if the throwdown does not resolve things, the Pilots need to reconsider their approach and try different narrative strategies; etc)


## Special Considerations


### Card Play Strategies

Use your Aces wisely! They are valuable as trumping cards when Pushing, but they are also useful for activating your Pilots' special Techs. Don't play them unless you have to.

Also remember that Twos are the lowest, and Tens are the highest, but Aces then beat Tens, and conversely Twos beat Aces. Hold onto those Twos and Aces until the right moment, as they can be quite valuable!


### PVP Throwdowns

Pilots can opt to fight each other using these rules with no required procedural changes. Just make sure to clearly choose sides at the beginning!

If this intra-team fight is over sufficiently serious and dramatic issues, Coach may declare that every Push action taken in the conflict triggers +Strife, and doubly so for those outside of Strike Range.
