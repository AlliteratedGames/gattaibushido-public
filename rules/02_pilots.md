### Start Small, and Take Your Time

The rules of this game don't actually have all that many moving parts, but there are a *lot* of ways in which you can move what little parts there are. The playbooks were designed to make the introduction to the core components easier to process, with Role-targeted pieces up front. Focus on the basics in front of you, and take your time figuring them out.

# The Team Creation Process

(now you got the game basics laid out, let's make your team! this is probably going to be an entire session of play)

(note: if you're only getting together for a one-shot game, skip all of this. Instead, use the condensed session flow in Appendix XX, on page SQUARP)

(Basic Flow:

1. First Contact Scene
2. Catching Up with the World
3. Choose and Fill Out the Playbooks
4. Round Out the Team


## Step 1: The First Contact Scene

If this is a brand new campaign with a brand new team of pilots, you should first play through the "First Contact" tutorial and world establishment scene. It is extremely useful not just for teaching new players the core basics of the rules system, but also for setting up extended details on your group's own personalized game world and campaign focus. The full details on the First Contact scene are detailed in their own chapter in Coach's section of the rules (page SQUARP).


## Step 2: Catching Up with the World

This team creation process assumes that the new characters are a group of fresh young Battle School mecha Pilots living as legacy to the events played out in the First Contact scene. Your group's game world may differ somewhat due to the unique parameters set forth in your own First Contact, but the process here should not be that heavily impacted by divergent story origins. Once you play the First Contact to a suitable conclusion, it's time to fill in the gaps between then and the "present" day in which the rest of the extended game will take place.


##### How Long has Passed?

Discussing as a group, figure out how much time has passed since the First Contact scene's events. Five years? A hundred? Only a few days? Figure out together what has changed in the world since then, and how the "Battle School" (provided your follows the default assumption) fits into the story today.

Along with the passing of time, you should establish how far removed the new Pilots are from the First Contact characters. Are any of those original characters still alive? Are any of them still in the group today, even? Are they teachers and mentors, or pariahs and cautionary stories? Are they nothing more than legends of the distant past, or do they still interact with the group today on a regular basis?


##### How are Your Robos Summoned?

If you haven't already established this fact, now is the time to do so. How does the team call their robos into a fight? Below are some examples from our many playtest games:

* The Robos are manually dispatched from their orbital hangar base, and the Pilots must be physically present there to launch them.
* The Robos are delivered along a vast network of underground tunnels, bursting from the ground at their destination when the Pilots call them from the field.
* The Robos are direct physical manifestations of the Pilots' own psyches, and spring forth on the spot from power crystals the Pilots each carry with them.
* The Robos are great bio-organic beasts which accompany the Pilots everywhere, and the Pilots *ride* them.
* The Robos are *actually the Pilots themselves* who grow to gargantuan shapes and sizes when they get angry!

This is primarily a matter of thematic choice, especially if you're wishing to emulate the setup of one of your favorite shows. Either way, everyone can still take part in Rumbles, and the rules regarding those play modes do not change.


## Step 3: Choose and Fill Out the Playbooks

Next, it's time to choose your individual team Chromas. Coach will print out and lay forward the character playbooks for everyone to see and discuss. Each is a color-themed character booklet that will guide you through a series of choices to make about your Pilot, as well as a few choices that you get to make about the *other* Pilots, and even a few that *they* get to make about *you*. Each is crafted to fill a specific role in the team, with assigned uniform colors inspired by (but not subservient to) genre media from the game's previously-mentioned sources of inspiration.


##### First Red and Green

**However**, before you all leap up and grab at them, there are two specific playbooks that should be explained first: Red (the Captain) and Green (the Noob). These playbooks have core story-structure requirements that must be considered before we go further.

Every team needs a Captain. As far as the playbooks are concerned, that job is Red's. Red is a required role for every new game, and the player who chooses the playbook must be prepared and eager to try and lead the Team. Red works best when she is guided by a player that really wishes to role-play the actions (and burdens!) of command.

Green, on the other hand, is not a required role for a new game, but she does have noteworthy built-in rank-based role-playing requirements. Green is the Noob, the most junior member on the team's roster. The Team will likely assign her the most demeaning of duties, and she'll often end up a scapegoat for the failures of others. Her player must be willing and eager to play out that complete entry-level experience, because that's what makes her truly excel in the end.


##### Then Everyone Else

Once a player has chosen the Red playbook, let the others pick as they will. After each Pilot player has chosen a playbook, put the unused ones away. You should now go through the playbooks' instructions step by step as a team. Many of them will involve other players at the table, and they work best if everyone moves through them at the same pace.

Everyone should take care to note all of their derived stats, like Hand Size, Buffers, Charges, and so on. Instructions on these are included in your playbooks!


## Step 4 (FINAL): Round Out the Team

(with playbooks completed, finalize the team details and begin play!)


##### Team Establishment Questions

(everyone work together to answer some narrative questions about the Team)

**What unique pre-battle ritual does your team have?** As a team you should develop some special ritual that the Pilots engage in right before a fight that they know is coming. Maybe the whole team recites their team code aloud, or jams out their favorite songs in That Popular Rock Music Game (TM), or even disobeys school protocol entirely and just gets really trashed together!

If the Pilots all actively make an effort to role-play this ritual each time in-game, Coach may give the team a Harmony boost. Conversely, if they fail to perform their team rituals at crucial moments, Coach may instead trigger a +Schism microevent.

**What are your weird Team taboos?** What odd taboos does your Team adhere to, no matter how obscure or nonsensical they may be? Never leave port without a cat on board? Always accept an offered drink? Never touch another Pilot's Robo? Never start a mission with an unkept bunkroom?

**Which of you is known as Coach's pet?** Is it true? Who does this bother the most? Who couldn't give a rat's ass either way?

**What is your unit's Motto?** What slogan or such statement do you frequently say to one another, that's maybe even printed on your jackets? Does anyone in the Team actually care about it?

**What do you call your final form?** Combo Drive? Ultimate Form Fusion? Mega-Dino-Maximus? ATHENA PRIME!?! You can answer this now, or wait until the fusion first happens during play for a bit more suspense.

Finally: **What is your team name?** Ultra Mega Assault Division? Team Triple Triumph? Loser Legion? The War Warriors?


##### Starting Resources

In *Gattaibushido*, the Team is almost another character unto itself. Your Team consists of three Locations (the Barracks, the Bunker, and the Hangar), which in turn give you three special Team Resources: Fan Club, Armory, and Pit Crew, respectively. More detail on the Team Locations and Resources can be found starting on p. SQUARP. For now you need to determine at what levels your Team's three Resources begin.

Each of the three Resources begins at a free base amount of 1. As your group goes through the playbooks and creates the team, each playbook will include instructions that increase these Resources somewhat. Once all of the chosen playbooks have been completed and their starting adjustments applied, the initial Team Resource ratings are finalized.


##### Starting Harmony

Finally, lay out the team Harmony sheet, and have a handy token or figurine ready to represent their location on it during play. The Team begins a new campaign with a default base Harmony of 4 (Green). Apply any "Starting Harmony" mods from the filled-out playbooks, if applicable. Subtract 1 point for each point of Schism accrued during the First Contact scene - those First Contact actions can really color the tone of the future team! When finished, if the total is less than 1 (Red, the minimum) then raise it to 1. Likewise if the total is greater than 7 (Violet, the maximum) then lower it to 7.


##### Define Your Salute!

Each team has their own special salute. It could be as simple as "All hands in the middle, then GO TEAM!" Or it could be something hands-off, or more subtle or complex. Define it together, and then starting with the next time your group meets it will open every play session.

With that, the Team is now Complete.



## OPTIONAL: The Custom Build Process

(don't want to use a playbook? check with Coach and the others first; then use this process to build a completely custom-from-scratch character; replaces Step 2 in the team creation process for you; still try and keep along with the others)

(**PLAYTEST NOTE:** considering making this a "blank" playbook instead, could also serve as a template for third-party stuff if there's an interest; this is going to come later after much further playbook testing; etc)


# Pilot Playbooks (INSERT PLAYBOOKS HERE)

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** This section will be expanded in the final print. Currently the playbooks are being developed in separate files.

(the character playbook, explained)

**Style Ideas:** Report Card, Yearbook bio, Yearbook quote, Data Panel Readout


###### (SIDEBAR: "Chromas, Daisho, and Robos")

> Your playbook gives you a number of creative options for your Pilot, but the three main sources of power are your Chroma, your Daisho, and your Robo. Each of these aspects give you a number of cool in-game abilities, but they do so in very different ways.
>
> Your Pilot's Chroma provides the main bulk of your power and versatility. Her Chroma Techs will be your core tools for empowerment, both in and out of the mecha cockpits.
>
> Her custom Daisho also provides Techs, but they are intended to be minor extensions of ability. These can be used to either boost your base Chroma Techs, or instead diversify your skills and keep you from being an overly-specialized one-trick pony.
>
> Finally, your Robo mainly serves as an extension of your Pilot's core persona. While it provides some minor thematic abilities, it's primary purpose is as a vessel for Rumbles and the Final Form.



# Character Details Compendium (restructure in process)

The following chapter serves as an organized reference to all of the Pilot- and Team-specific mechanical components. This chapter is quite huge, so if this is your first time reading through this manual, you might want to skip on to the next core part of the book at p. SQUARP to keep learning the game's basics, and then come back to this part later when you need to reference something.

The various subsections below are alphabetized by component name. Pilot-specific components come first, followed by Team-specific components at the end.


## Pilots: Buffers

Your Pilot has a handy **Buffer** that starts with a base amount of tokens equal to her **Synapse** stat - we recommend using blue tokens to easily track these. This can be further increased by Gear, Techs, and more.

By default you can use these tokens to prevent potential +Purge, +Schism, and +Trauma damage that your Pilot would suffer from or directly cause to herself. Other Techs and abilities can extend their usefulness even further.

As you use your Buffer to prevent damage, you tick off these tokens. They are a limited and valuable resource, so use them wisely! Buffers refresh at the beginning of every new Scenario (not session), and can also be restored mid-game as a result of various Techs and Actions during play.


## Pilots: Charges & Techs

**Charges** are expendable, fluctuating pools of energy that you use to empower your various Techs. They are primarily built up through the revelation of Pilot Deck Jokers, as well as the use of special Actions, Gear, and Techs.

**Techs** are the special powers that your Pilots have at their disposal, to assist them with overcoming the challenges before them. Most Techs will come from your Pilot's choice of Chroma, Daisho, and Robo. Many Techs require the expenditure of Charges, and as such are called **Charge Techs**, while all other non-Charge-requiring Techs are called **Passive Techs**.


### Your Charge Pool

Your pool of Charges is commonly represented by a pile of tokens that you keep in front of you while you play. Your base maximum is equal to *twice* the value of your **Circuit** stat, derived from your Commitments. This maximum can be increased through a handful of Chroma, Daisho, and Robo Techs, too.

As you use your powers, you will remove Charge tokens from your pool. You will regain spent Charges through the +Chargeup microevent, which is most commonly triggered by Resonant Strikes, some special Techs, and the revelation of Jokers from the Pilot Deck. Unless certain Techs specifically state otherwise, the number of Charges in your pool can never exceed your maximum allowance.


### Using Charge Techs

The primary purpose of Charge Techs is to provide mechanical advantage during a Throwdown. The more powerful the Tech, the more Charges it costs to activate. For *most* Charge Techs, the default cost to activate the Tech is equal to the power rank at which you are activating it. Unless specified otherwise, you can always choose to activate a known Tech at a lower rank. For example, if you have a Charge Tech at rank 3, you can choose to activate it at rank 1 of ability, and only spend 1 Charge.

Some Charge Techs specify different costs entirely, or instead alter the costs and output of the Core Techs (below). When a Charge Tech specifies its own Charge cost, use that cost instead of the default.


#### Charge Techs Outside of Conflicts

Unless specified by the Tech, your Pilot has access to all of her Charge Techs outside of Throwdowns, as well. While most of them might not seem to have much mechanical application outside of a fight, you may still be able to make a case for it in the moment, especially if you are aiming to create a really cool story moment with it.

In such cases, you have two options, chosen by Coach. If the main focus of the action is to add awesome narrative flair, he may simply decide that your Tech activates with no cost. When this happens, you're free to narrate something cool and make the moment extra memorable.

Otherwise Coach may decide that the Tech would be advantageous enough that using it will require Charges. In this case, you need to spend a number of Charges equal to the rank at which you are activating the Tech. Then resolve the story and mechanics of the moment, and move on.


### The Core Charge Techs

In addition to their own personal Techs, *every* Pilot has the following basic Charge Techs at their disposal, which can also be found on their Pilot Record Sheets. Note that some of these may be made obsolete by stronger, more powerful Chroma-specific Techs.

* **Boost Strike (Assist):** Increase the Strike Range for your Team's next Counter. **Cost:** 1 Charge per +1 to Strike
* **Restore Buffer (Story/Assist):** Restore spent Buffer tokens to yourself or another Pilot. **Cost:** 1 Charge per 1 Buffer token restored.
* **AGSOMAFA! (Assist):** Remove a card from play, gain its rank in immediate Charges. See further below for details.


### The AGSOMAFA! Action

The AGSOMAFA! is a potentially-disastrous action that any Pilot can attempt during any Throwdown in which they are an active participant. To activate the AGSOMAFA!, the player must first describe the desperation by which their Pilot is calling on her greatest powers, in as thematically-appropriate a manner as possibly. Once done, she then takes a card from her Hand or an active Faction and Removes it from play for the remainder of her Pilot's *existence* in the ongoing story, regardless of how long your campaign may play.

Once the card is chosen and Removed, she gains its value in immediate personal Charges, which can temporarily exceed her Max Charges limit, but must all be used before the end of the Throwdown. If she has any Charges remaining at the conclusion of the Throwdown, she burns them immediately and inflicts +Trauma:Self(X) where X equals the # of Charges burned.

**Limit:** The Team may activate the Agsomafa no more than once per game session.


## Pilots: Chromas (Core)

These are the Core Eight that will be focused on heavily throughout the entire book:

* Black: The Wild Card (beloved reaper, abundant void)
* Blue: The Brains (strategist, mastermind, all-around smart lady)
* Green: The Noob (only direction is up, without limit)
* Orange: The Otaku (hyperfocus to the max)
* Pink: The Heart of the Team (right there, on the sleeve, for all to see)
* Purple: The Rebel (she'll prove you wrong, mark her words)
* Red: The Captain (the hero she deserves to be)
* Yellow: The Tank (endurance, perseverance, dominance)

Playbook base data is contained within this document as a reference until the final playbook formats are laid out for use.


### The Chromas


#### Black: The Wild Card (beloved reaper, abundant void)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Black (The Wild Card): -1 Harmony, +1 Armory, +2 Fan Club, +1 Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Black (The Wild Card): -1 Harmony, +2 Fan Club

**Lesson Trigger:** Black earns a Lesson when circumstances force her to follow the predictable path.

**Gambit Specialties:** *All* of Black's Gambits are played Blind from the Deck, and count as her Specialty. If the resulting card is Black, ignore its value and use 12 instead (or 11 in Ichi Mode). If the resulting card is Red, ignore its value and "fail" the Gambit.


##### Primary Tech

**New Special Action: "Wild Power!"** (Passive, Black Pilot)

If there's one thing you can always expect from Black, it's that she never does what's expected. When Black plays down a card to Counter or Escalate, she can choose to spend up to her Wild Power rank in Charges, and then Flip the same number of cards from her Deck. She can choose to play any one of those cards instead of her already-played card. If Black plays one of the Flipped cards instead, she can then choose to double the Charge cost and return her initially-played card to her Hand. After a card is selected for Play, Discard the rest.


##### Secondary Tech

**New Special Action: "Wild Surge!"** (Passive, Black Pilot)

Black gains power from the whims of chaos, drawing greater boons from both good fortune *and* the looming threats of disaster. When a Player Joker is revealed, Black gains up to her this Tech's rank in temporary bonus Buffers, in addition to the normal Joker effects. When a Coach Joker is revealed, she gains up to this Tech's rank in temporary bonus Charges. In either case, these temporary pools cannot exceed this Tech's rank. When she would spend Buffers or Charges during play, she must spend them from these pools first.


#### Blue: The Brains (strategist, mastermind, all-around smart lady)

(While Red leads from the front, Blue leads from the middle.)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Blue (The Brains): +1 each to Armory, Fanclub, and Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Blue (The Brains): +1 to a Resource of your choosing

**Lesson Trigger:** Blue earns a Lesson when she causes disaster through over-thinking and obsessive planning.

**Gambit Specialties:** Logistics, project management, economic planning (i.e. "the boring stuff").


##### Primary Tech

**Strategic Action!** Each rank invested in this Tech gives Blue an exclusive new Throwdown Action chosen from the list below. In each case, X equals Blue's rank in this tech.

* "**Strategic Foresight!**" (Assist): Spend up to X Charges and look at same number of cards from the top of any Deck. Then return them to the top of that Deck in any order. You cannot tell anyone else what they are. This is the *only* time when a Pilot is allowed to touch the cards in Coach's Deck.
* **Strategic Override!** (Assist): Spend up to X Charges, and up to an equal number Pilots in the Throwdown must discard a combined total of that many cards. Blue's target opponent must discard an equal number of cards. This cannot force them to discard their last card.
* "**Strategic Reassessment!**" (Assist): Spend Charges to draw up to X cards from either the top of the Deck (for 1 Charge) or the top of the Trash (for 2 Charges). Then, Discard an equal number of cards.
* **Strategic Reconfiguration!** (Assist): Spend up to X Charges and take up to X cards from up to X Pilots involved in the fight. You can then choose to distribute up to X cards to up to X Pilots involved in the fight. These do not need to be the same cards or Pilots.
* **Strategic Retreat!** (Assist): Trigger +Schism, then Spend up to X Charges and completely withdraw from the Throwdown. Give the same number of cards from your hand to up to as many other Pilots that remain. You are not allowed to participate further, nor be targeted by the Outcome, but you must participate in the Drop and Draw stage.


##### Secondary Tech

**Advance Warning!:** Blue is always prepared for the dangers ahead. Once per Mission Scenario per rank invested in this Tech, when one of Coach's Jokers is revealed, Blue can choose to immediately send it to the bottom of the Deck, skipping all Joker-related events and effects.


#### Green: The Noob (only direction is up, without limit)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Green (The Noob): +1 Fan Club, +2 Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Green (The Noob): +1 Pit Crew

**Lesson Trigger:** Green earns a lesson when her enthusiastic inexperience gets the entire team into trouble.

**Gambit Specialties:** Everyone else's annoying, demeaning, and back-breaking crap work.


##### Primary Tech

**I've Got This!** Green has more options to keep Pushing against seemingly-unbeatable high cards during Throwdowns. Each use costs a single Charge.
1. In a Throwdown, Green beats Aces with Twos *and* Threes
2. ...and Fours
3. ...and she can beat Kings with Twos!


##### Secondary Tech

**It Was Like That When I Found It!** Green is adept at avoiding the blame for the worst of situations, and preserving the status quo. During a new Mission Scenario, Green can choose to negate self-caused +Schism events, up to a number of occurrences equal to her rank in this Tech.


##### Special Notes

Green is at the very bottom of the Team's hierarchy, both officially and socially. She's the newest to join, and hasn't had time to make really strong friendships yet. As such, she gets assigned the absolute shit duties no one else wants, and is sent out on pointless errands whenever they want to get rid of her. If you are interested in starting play as the lowest of the team and taking on this role-playing challenge, then Green is the Pilot for you!


#### Orange: The Otaku (hyperfocus to the max)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Orange (The Otaku): +2 Armory, +1 Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Orange (The Otaku): +1 Armory

**Lesson Trigger:** Orange earns a Lesson when her over-reliance upon Gear and gadgets makes a bad situation even worse.

**Gambit Specialties:** Anything to do with cool never-before-encountered tech.


##### Primary Tech

**Shiny New Toys!** Orange gains extra versatility with her Gear loadouts.
1. Orange can spend Charges to re-Activate Gear that was already used in the same Scene/Conflict. Charge Cost = Gear Tier.
2. Orange can now freely exchange her Charges for Armory Resources, or vice versa, at a 2:1 Charge:Armory exchange rate.
3. At during the Outcome stage of a Throwdown, Orange can spend Charges to recover any Gear sacrificed during that Throwdown. Charge cost = 2x Gear Tier.


##### Secondary Tech

**Private Arsenal!** Orange is constantly acquiring cool new gadgets and weapons for her private collection, and knows who to talk to to acquire 'special" goods. These may or may not be "regulation" per se, so it's a good thing she's also adept at hiding them away until just the right time! At each rank of this Tech, Orange acquires an additional two (2) Gear slots that can be used for any type. Additionally, she enjoys a discount to all Gear acquisitions equal to her Tech rank, to a minimum of 1 cost.


#### Pink: The Heart of the Team (right there, on the sleeve, for all to see)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Pink (The Heart of the Team): +1 Harmony, +2 Fan Club

**Recurring Mods:**
* Pink (The Heart of the Team): +1 Harmony

**Lesson Trigger:** Pink earns a Lesson when the rest of the Team lets her down.

**Gambit Specialties:** Performance, communication, and diplomacy.


##### Primary Tech

**We Can Do This!** Pink is will do her best to keep the Team's spirits as high as she can, even if she has to hurt herself in the process. Pink has the ability to hold strong against low Harmony by taking on the burdens of the Team. If the Team's Harmony would drop equal to or below her rank in this Tech, she can choose to prevent any amount of it by triggering +Trauma:Self with damage equal to *twice* the amount of Harmony loss prevented. She can choose to spend her own Charges to soak this damage as if they were Buffers.


##### Secondary Tech

**Friendship is Power!:** Pink is always there to get your back, even when everyone else has reached their limit. Pink can use more than one Assist action on the Pilots' turn of a Throwdown. Each turn, her Assist limit is equal to 1 plus her rank in this Tech.


#### Purple: The Rebel (she'll prove you wrong, mark her words)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Purple (The Rebel): -1 Harmony, +3 Armory, +1 Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Purple (The Rebel): -1 Harmony, +1 Armory, +1 Pit Crew

**Lesson Trigger:** Purple earns a Lesson when she does that thing that everyone told her not to do, and catastrophically fails at it.

**Gambit Specialties:** The pursuit of any action that the rest of the Team truthfully does not want her to pursue.


##### Primary Tech

Purple is not bound by anyone's rules and expectations. She does what she wants, in glorious, dangerous, and surprising ways. She acquires a new special action:

**Middle Finger Scream!** (Assist): This must be played immediately before you Counter in a Throwdown. Spend up to your Tech Rank in Charges, and decrease your Strike Range by twice that amount for your next Push. This can result in a negative Strike Range, which is exactly what you want. If using this power gives you negative Strike, you can Counter with a *lower* card than the top of the Pile, as long as the difference is within the new negative Strike. Your new, lower card is now on top.

* At rank 2, when you counter within negative Strike, you can choose to trigger +Schism anyway. If you do so, increase the multiplier of your Secondary tech by +1.
* At rank 3, when you use this power and strike "Negative Resonant," any excess Buffers and Charges generated by your Secondary Tech are distributed to your teammates as you see fit.


##### Secondary Tech

**You don't know me! I do what I want!** Purple draws strength when she causes dissonance within the Team. Whenever Purple triggers +Schism, she restores a number of Buffers *and* Charges equal to her Rank in this Tech. If this occurs in the pursuit of a course of action that she was specifically ordered not to follow beforehand, the amount restored is doubled.


##### Special Notes


#### Red: The Captain (the hero she deserves to be)

(Red leads from the front)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Red (The Captain): +1 Armory, +2 Fan Club

**Recurring Mods:**
* Red (The Captain): +1 Fan Club

**Lesson Trigger:** Red earns a Lesson when she gets everyone into greater danger by charging forth blindly.

**Gambit Specialties:** Athletics, bullheaded bravado, and just plain showing off.


##### Primary Tech

When Red seizes the moment of glory and perfection, her valor spreads into the world around her, changing the very nature of the battle. This gives Red the following new Tech:

**Inspiring Strike!** (Assist) Cost: # of Charges = current Throwdown stage. Activate when Countering or Escalating with a Resonant Strike. Effects based on rank:

1. Red Draws X cards into her Hand
2. ...and triggers +Chargeup(X) to up to X involved other teammates (excluding Red)
3. ...and inflicts +Trauma(X) to an involved opponent


##### Secondary Tech

**Hero Power!** As the Captain of the Team, Red must strive to be excellent at all things, and set an example of strength and reliability for the others. Likewise, she must be able to fill in the gaps between the others' specialties, ensuring the Team is properly balanced. Each time she advances this Tech, she chooses one of the following permanent benefits. Each can be chosen only once.

* Base Strike Range increases +2
* Max Buffers increase by +2
* Max Charges increase by +4
* Max Hand increases +1
* Add a recurring Scenario bonus of +2 to all three Team Resources


##### Special Notes



#### Yellow: The Tank (endurance, perseverance, dominance)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Yellow (The Tank): +2 Armory, +1 Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Yellow (The Tank): +1 Armory

**Lesson Trigger:** Yellow earns a Lesson when she causes loss to the Team by turtling up.

**Gambit Specialties:** Any task involving standing her ground and holding the line.


##### Primary Tech

**Fortify!** As the stalwart Aegis of the team, Yellow has a much easier time restoring her Buffers. This directly alters the core "Restore Buffer" Tech.

1. Yellow restores her own Buffers at 1:1 Charge cost.
2. Yellow's max Buffer pool is now equal to twice the adjusted max (Synapse + other mods).
3. Yellow restores her own Buffers at 1:2 Charge cost.


##### Secondary Tech

**Protective Friendship!** Yellow is the Tank Queen of damage prevention! When a teammate is targeted by Trauma during a Throwdown in which Yellow is active, Yellow can choose to redirect that Trauma to herself instead. *Additionally* at each rank (including rank 1), pick one of the following powers:

* When Yellow suffers the effects of unmitigated +Trauma, she triggers +Fortify:Self.
* When Yellow suffers the effects of unmitigated +Trauma, she inflicts +Trauma(1) to the source of the original Damage.
* When Yellow spends a Buffer to prevent incoming Trauma, she triggers +Recover:Self.
* When Team Harmony is reduced, Yellow triggers +Fortify:Self for each point of reduction.
* When a teammate fails to prevent Trauma during a Throwdown in which Yellow is active, Yellow triggers +Chargeup:Self.


### Pilots: Chromas (Advanced)

(PLAYTEST NOTE: Currently in Playbook development; these are three advanced roles, requiring greater considerations during play)


#### Gray


#### Rainbow: The Chameleon (ERROR::STACK OVERFLOW::VARIABLE UNDEFINED)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Rainbow (The Chameleon): +1 Armory, +1 Fan Club, +1 Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Rainbow (The Chameleon): +1 to a Resource of your choosing

**Lesson Trigger:** TBD

**Gambit Specialties:** TBD


##### Primary Tech

**Double Rainbow!** If one of her sisters lets her power flow, Rainbow can take that power, amplfy it, and make it her own. With this Tech, Rainbow can mimic *any* Drive or Assist Tech previously used by another Pilot in the same Throwdown. Rainbow can only activate the mimicked Tech at a Rank equal to or less than her own rank in this Tech. The Charge cost is equal to the current Stage of the active Throwdown.


##### Secondary Tech

**Harmonic Sync!** (Assist) Rainbow draws power directly from the current state of the Team's Harmony. Based on her rank in this Tech (X) and the Team's current position on the Harmony scale, Rainbow has the following Assist action that she can use when she would play a Resonant Strike:

* **Red** For 1 charge, trigger +Rally and inflict +Trauma:Choice(X).
* **Orange** For 2 charges, trigger +Rally and +Fortify:Self(X)
* **Yellow** For 3 charges, trigger +Rally and +Recover:Self(X)
* **Green** For 4 charges, trigger +Rally and +Chargeup:All_Other_Pilots(X)
* **Blue** For 5 charges, trigger +Rally and +Recover:Choice(X)
* **Indigo** For 6 charges, trigger +Rally, +Recover:Choice(X), and +Fortify:Choice(X)
* **Violet** For 7 charges, trigger +Recover:Pilots(X) and inflict +Trauma:Choice(X).


##### PLAYBOOK SPECIAL


#### Branwen: The Dog (aww whoosa good girl? you are! yes you are!)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Branwen (The Dog): +1 Harmony, +2 Fan Club

**Recurring Mods:**
* Branwen (The Dog): +1 Harmony

**Lesson Trigger:** Branwen earns a lesson when she is deeply admonished by her Bonded Pilot for in-game actions.

**Gambit Specialties:** TBD


##### Primary Tech

**Rare Pupper!** At each rank of this Tech, including the first, Branwen acquires an ability of your choice from the following list. In each case, the variable X represents her rank in this Tech:

* **"Pilot’s Best Friend!"** (Assist) Branwen can choose to allow up to X of her own Charges to be used by her Bonded Pilot this Turn. These Charges must be spent immediately.
* **"Sic em!"** (Assist) Use before another Pilot makes a Play. Spend 1 Charge, and increase her Strike by +X. This represents any number of actions Branwen could take in assisting the fight, such as gnawing at the leg, flanking attacks, and so on.
* **"Therapy Branwen!"** During the Outcome stage of a Throwdown in which Branwen participated, she can spend up to X Charges to negate the same amount of Schism tokens built up on the Harmony track.

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** Most of Branwen's abilities are directly converted from her predecessor Bronson, in Motobushido. I'd like to add two more options to her Primary tech list of choices, but need more feedback.


##### Secondary Tech

**"Look What I Found!"** Branwen can scrounge for pretty much anything, and tends to bring back the weirdest things as “trophies” for her Team. Once per game session while outside of an active conflict, Branwen can go off on her own volition to randomly search for stuff. This is handled as a Gambit with the following results:

* "No, but..." Branwen finds something that is completely useless (but she’s very proud of). If praised for her bizarre (and probably disgusting) discovery, she triggers +Chargeup:Self(TechRank).
* "Yes, but..." Branwen finds something useful (worth this Tech's Rank in Resource points) but gets in big trouble.
* "Yes, and..." Branwen finds something potentially very useful (worth this Tech's rank in Resource points) or otherwise helpful to the Team’s goals (such as a point of invested Favor on a Faction).


##### PLAYBOOK SPECIAL

Branwen must declare another Pilot on the Team to be her "Bonded Pilot." While she is spiritually a companion to the entire Team, she is *most* connected to this particular Pilot over all the others. This other Pilot does not have to be Branwen's willing "owner" per se, because in this transaction Branwen simply claims a Bond of her own choosing. Should her Bonded Pilot manage to cross the Rainbow Bridge before she does, Branwen must choose a new Bond.


## Pilots: Commitments & Attributes

Your Pilot's Commitments determine the basis for most all of the character mechanics. There are three core Commitments, each divided into two paired Stats (for a total of six Stats). These stats are dualities; within each Commitment, the numerical ranks of the Stats always add up to a total of 6. The individual Stats serve as the foundation for almost every core mechanic your Pilot uses.

Each of these stats represents a core dichotomy that pulls hard at your Pilot's core self identity. Her very existence as a Gattai Pilot demands a balance of commitment to often-conflicting agendas - a balance that is tenuous at even the best of times. The left-hand-side of each Commitment pair represents the needs of your Pilot's individual core of human identity. The right-hand-side represents the hard demands placed upon her as a dedicated mecha Pilot in the war to protect humanity. These balances can shift frequently, sometimes to deleterious effect.

It is entirely possible to play a character with a 6 in one stat and a 0 in its opposing stat. This simply means that the Pilot gains no mechanical benefit at all from the empty stat, and they had best play _very_ carefully - or not, because causing your own doom can sometimes make for very fun gaming!


### Commitment to the Team: Solo and Sync (Bonus Draws)

**Core Stats:** Solo (leftward) vs Sync (rightward)  
**Stat Mechanic:** Determines your *Bonus Draws* at the beginning of Throwdowns.  
**Tied To:** Team Chroma

A Pilot with a higher Solo stat in this Commitment tends to be more focused on their own personal goals, often causing strife by putting her needs desires before those of her Team. A Pilot with a higher Sync stat instead more often puts the needs of the Team first, sometimes to the detriment of her own mental and physical health.

Your ranks in these stats determine how many bonus draws you receive at the beginning of new Throwdowns, based on your motivations within the conflict at hand. If your Pilot is acting primarily in her own self-interests, she draws based on Solo. If she instead fights to push the interests of the Team, then she draws based on Sync.


### Commitment to the Fight: Flesh and Steel (Strike Range)

**Core Stats:** Flesh (leftward) vs Steel (rightward)  
**Stat Mechanic:** Determines base *Strike Ranges* in conflicts.  
**Tied To:** Personal Daisho

A Pilot with a higher Flesh stat tends to go more with the flow of the world around her, starting few fights of her own volition, but fighting harder when the war comes to her. A Pilot with a higher Steel stat instead more often brings the fight on her own terms, taking action with confidence and force, at the cost of diminished adaptability when she is not in direct control of her circumstances.

Your rank in this stat gives you a solid and tangible fighting edge in battle, setting your base Strike Ranges for all card-play during Throwdowns. If the throwdown was initiated by your opponent, then your base Strike Range is equal to your Flesh stat. If you started the fight, then use your Steel stat instead.


### Commitment to the Future: Synapse and Circuit (Buffers and Charges)

**Core Stats:** Synapse (leftward) vs Circuit (rightward)  
**Stat Mechanic:** Determines the pilot’s base *Buffers* and max *Charges*.  
**Tied To:** Personal Robo

A Pilot with a higher Synapse stat has a much closer relation to the deep resiliency that protects humanity in its push to the stars. She excels at weathering all that the war can throw at her, often to the detriment of her own martial power. A Pilot with a higher Circuit stat instead has a greater connection to the weapons and machines that she must employ, sacrificing resilience for a stronger reserve of applied power.

Your rank in this stat determines the balance between your maximum Buffers and Charges. Your base Buffers pool is equal to your Synapse Stat, while your maximum pool of Charges is equal to *twice* (2x) your Circuit stat.


### Managing Your Commitments

At the start of a new Pilot's career, the playbooks are designed to give you an initial six-point balance between each of your Pilot's three Commitments. Likewise, this sets the maximum total in each of her three Commitments to an initial score of 6. This maximum can eventually increase through long-term character evolution, and can similarly *decrease* through repeated closeness to death.

Through extended play, there are a handful of circumstances in which these stat pairs may shift, and even a few in which their totals may increase or decrease. The mechanics of this are explained further below.


### Commitment Shifts

Some game effects may force you to make a shift in one direction or another. For example, Coach might decree that a decision you made to put the Team at risk in order to save your own life will Shift you up 1 in Solo and down 1 in Sync. To do that, raise the rank of the relevant Commitment Stat you are shifting toward by 1, and lower its pair by 1. The balance must be maintained, with both stats of the pair adding up to their parent Commitment's Maximum. No Stat can be dropped lower than Zero, however; if a forced shift would result in such a drop, ignore that shift and work with Coach to decide upon an alternate outcome.


### Commitment Increases through Evolution

When your Pilot evolves to specific tiers of power, her Commitment maximums may increase, usually by only +1 in a single Commitment. This allows you to add a single point to one of her six Stats, permanently increasing the maximum balance within that Commitment by +1.

Evolution is the *only* method for increasing a Commitment's maximum balance.


### Commitment Damage and Loss

If your Pilot suffers Trauma that is not otherwise deflected or absorbed (via Buffers, gear, or other effects), you must lower her Commitments as a result. For each point of Trauma thus received, you must pick one of her Commitments (your choice) and lower its maximum balance by 1. Then in turn you must pick one of that Commitment's Stats and likewise lower it by one. No stat can be lowered below zero.

Fortunately there exist a handful of methods in the game that can heal a damaged Commitment track, including locations, Techs, and Gear. These effects often require some form of card conflict. As long as the damage is healed before the end of the scenario (which in most cases means "before the Big Giant Monster is defeated"), then the loss is not permanent. However, if the damage to the balance is not recovered by the end of the Scenario, then that Commitment's balance maximum is permanently reduced, and that specific loss cannot be "healed" in any way.

Recovering from a permanent Commitment loss can only be done through Evolution. This is detailed in the Evolution section (p. XX).


###### (SIDEBAR: Permanent Loss is Good for the Story!)

> The idea of permanent stat loss in this game may come across as unfair during an initial read. However, I ask you to understand that this is an *expected* consequence of play, representing the unfortunate burnout of bright young lives who are thrown against great odds in the war to protect humanity from alien destruction. If this happens to your Pilot, embrace it, and see it as an opportunity for role-playing!


### Commitment Death

If any one of your Pilot's Commitment maximums is reduced to zero, she's at the precipice of her finality. You have a choice to make in this situation. Your first option - and the one I recommend most - is to embrace her departure from the game, and make it awesome. Depending on the circumstances that brought her here, she could die a glorious death in battle, be put in a completely broken-down state and sent off to a hospital for the rest of her days, or even just give up and retire from service. I encourage you to revel in this moment, for loss and transition are crucial components of every tragic space mecha story.

If you don't want her participation in the story to end just yet, then your other choice is to work with Coach, and try to develop together an alternate outcome that is more suitable to both your goals as a player, and the story that everyone is working to create.


## Pilots: Daisho

(PLAYTEST NOTE: Currently in the Playbooks)

A Daisho consists of a base Frame, which is then further modified by additional Qualities. The Frame sets the Daisho's core Tech, and Qualities allow you to then customize it further. Each Daisho can be customized with at most three Qualities, which cannot be swapped or removed. Since there is no hard limit on the number of Daisho your Pilot can possess, provided your Evolutions are plentiful then you can potentially build out quite an arsenal of them.

**Notes and Limitations:**

* Your Pilot's Daisho are hers and hers alone, and cannot be used by any other Pilot.
* No two Pilots can begin play with the same starting Daisho frame. For Pilots added later during play, this is up to Coach's discretion.
* A Daisho can have no more than three Quality techs, but you can build an unlimited number of Daisho provided bountiful access to Evolutions.
* You cannot remove or swap Qualities once they are chosen and applied.
* You can only ever carry and use a single Daisho, but you can change out your carried Daisho by returning to your Bunker. Only the Techs of your currently-carried Daisho are accessible.
* Being a core evolution resource, your Daisho can never be permanently removed from your character. It may be temporarily removed or disabled during play as consequences of story, but will always return to your possession at the beginning of a new scenario, if not sooner.


###### (SIDEBAR: Why Daisho?)

> The name "*daisho*" is used here for a couple of reasons. First off, I needed a single memorable term to use that would clearly differentiate the importance of the Pilot's core focus weapon from that of common weaponry she can get from her Gear loadout (Gear is explained later, on p.XX). And it needed to fit the flow of the "core three" empowerments, alongside Chroma and Robo. Second, I liked the idea of including a noted reference to both the name of the game - Gattai-**bushido** - as well as the heavy samurai themes of its predecessor, *Motobushido*. Given that real-world daisho were seen as one of the most visible and spiritual marks of station for the samurai of old, the term fits both those needs quite nicely.
>
> What does the term mean for your own game settings? Well that's up to you. You can ignore the term entirely if you wish, but I think it's fun to come up with unique ways of incorporating it if possible. Perhaps your Pilots are indeed directly chosen from Space Samurai breeding, and they use the term as a hand-down from ages before. Or perhaps it's an acronym in your military structure - I suggest **Dynamic Armament Integration System for Human Overdrive!**


### Building Your Daisho

Your initial Daisho consists of a base Frame, which bestows a core **Frame Tech**. You then can modify it with a single Quality. As you invest evolutions into your weapons, you can power up your Frame Tech rank (up to 3) or add more new Qualities, turning it into a versatile combo-tastic tool.


#### Daisho Frames

Below is a list of sample base Frames and their accompanying core Techs. Passive Frame Techs apply at all times while the Daisho is carried. Active Frame Techs must be used as an action within their described circumstances.

* Aegis, Shield: (Passive) Your max Buffers is increased by 1.
* Axe, Hammer: (Passive) You deliver +Trauma when your Counter strikes true.
* Bombs, Cannon: (Active, Assist) Trigger +Ruin, then double Strike for next Drive.
* Boomerang, Chakrams: (Active, Special) During Drop/Draw end phase of Throwdown, you can add any one card from the Pile to your Hand after it is resolved, not to exceed your Max Hand.
* Bulwark: (Passive) Your Strike is decreased by 1, but your max Buffers increase by 3.
* Claws, Knives: (Passive) Your Strike is decreased by 1, but your max Charges increase by 3.
* Gauntlet, Pistols: (Passive) Your Bonus Draw is increased by 1.
* Bow, Rifle: (Passive) Your Strike Range is increased by 1.
* Multi-Tool: (Passive) All of your Gambit plays are at +2 value
* Scythe: (Passive) Whenever you cause +Trauma, trigger +Fortify:Self.
* Spear, Sword: (Passive) When your Counter strikes true, trigger +Chargeup:Self(2).
* Staff, Whip: (Passive) When you Block, trigger +Chargeup:Self.


#### Daisho Qualities

In addition to the core Frame, each Daisho can have one to three empowering Qualities. Many of these give special Assist actions you can use during Throwdowns, while others give minor Passive enhancements. Qualities are best used to make unique power combos that enhance the rest of your Pilot's skills in clever ways.

* Charge: (Passive) Your "Restore Buffer" Basic Charge Tech only costs 1:1 (default is 2:1)
* Energy: (Assist) Spend 1 Charge, target Pilot gains 1 Charge.
* Experimental: (Passive) When your Played card is Blocked, you inflict and resolve +Trauma:Self(1) and then trigger +Chargeup:Self(2).
* Friendship: (Assist) When you would trigger +Schism, spend 2 Charges to prevent it.
* Giga-: (Passive) When you would inflict +Trauma, you can spend 1 charge to increase Trauma amount by 1.
* Laser: (Passive) Your "Boost Strike" Basic Charge Tech only costs 1:1 (default is 2:1)
* Masochistic: (Passive) When you take damage, trigger +Chargeup:Self(X), with X = amount of damage not prevented by Buffers.
* Nega-: (Assist) Spend 2 Charges, then keep 1 card you would have Discarded.
* Power: (Assist) Discard a card, then increase your Strike by that card's pip rank.
* Pseudo-: (Assist) Spend 1 Charges, then re-trigger any other Daisho Assist Tech previously used during this Throwdown, at normal cost.
* Psy-: (Assist) Spend 1 Charge, look at any one card in any one player's Hand.
* Psycho-: (Assist) Trigger and resolve +Schism:Self, then trigger +Trauma:Choice and +Chargeup:Self.
* Razor: (Assist) Spend 3 Charges, then inflict +Trauma:Choice.
* Retro-: (Assist) Spend 2 Charges, then draw the top card of your Trash into your Hand.
* Sadistic: (Passive) When you inflict +Trauma, trigger +Chargeup:Self(1) per occurrence.
* Science: (Assist) Spend 1 charge, take 1 random cards from any one Hand, then return 1 card to that Hand
* Sonic: (Assist) Activate before you Escalate, and trigger +Chargeup:Self(2)
* Tactical: (Assist) Spend 1 Charge, then give 1 card from your Hand to player of choice.
* Thunder: (Assist) Spend 1 Charge, inflict and resolve +Trauma:Choice, and then either +Trauma:Self or +Ruin
* Turbo-: (Assist) Spend 1 Charges, then draw the top card of your Deck into your Hand.
* Vibro-: (Assist) Spend up to 3 Charges, opponent's Strike Range on their next Drive is decreased by an equal amount.
* Vortex: (Assist) Spend 2 Charges, then player of choice with two or more cards in their Hand discards a random card from their Hand.
* Xeno-: (Passive) Your Bonus Draw is reduced by 1 against Threats, but is increased by 2 against other Pilots.


## Pilots: Final Form

See "Pilots: Robos" on p. XX


## Pilots: Gear (IN PROGRESS)

In addition to cool powers, daisho, and robos, your Pilots also have access to a wide array of supplementary tools called **Gear**. These can be used out in the field to provide bonus effects and boosts, giving your Pilot just the edge she needs to get ahead of the enemy and complete her missions!

Gear is normally acquired via the Bunker location. By spending points of the Armory resource while at your team's Bunker, you can "rent" Gear for use on your upcoming mission. Unused (and *undamaged*) Gear at the end of a Mission can be returned to the Armory for a restoration of some of those spent Resource points. And sometimes Coach may even let your team find new pieces of Gear out in the field, too. This is entirely up to his discretion, though, so don't go out there expecting freebies.

Gear is distributed across four tiers of availability, and only upper classmen are allowed to use the higher-grade stuff. As a Freshman, you're only allowed to handle the Tier 1 stuff. But once you have proven yourself in the field and earned your letters, new ranks will open up to you. Sophomores can get Tier 2 stuff, Juniors Tier 3, and Seniors Tier 4. Rumor has it there are even more powerful gadgets available to Battle School Graduates, but we can neither confirm nor deny the validity of these allegations.


### Equipping Gear

All Gear is classified into one of three different types: Armor, Accessories, and Tools. Your Pilot begins her schooling with three available "slots" where she can equip her Gear, one for each of the three types. As you learn your lessons and rise in your Class, you'll get more slots to add more Gear. Some Chromas (such as Orange!) will have additional Gear options available to them as well.

However, aside from your allotment of Gear slots, you are unable to carry any other Gear with you into the field. If you find new Gear in the field, and your slots are full, you'll need to either swap an old item out with the new, find another Pilot to carry it, or else leave it behind.

Finally, you can not equip Gear of a higher Tier than your current Class. In other words, Freshmen can only equip Tier 1 Gear, Sophomores can equip up to Tier 2, and so on. Fortunately, any new and unclassified Gear that you find in the field has no assigned Tier, and is free game to Pilots of all classes! But once you bring it back home and add it to your Armory, Coach will assign it a Tier and you might not be able to check it out again until much later! See below.


### Acquiring Gear

The easiest way to get your hands on new Gear is by requisitioning it from your team's home base. While at your Bunker, you can spend points from your Armory resource to requisition Gear for a Mission. Each item costs a number of resource points equal to its Tier, but if the Gear is returned in good shape later you might be able to get those points back (this is Coach's call, though). Ultimately the availability of any Gear is up to Coach, and may change based on narrative events.

If you're lucky, you can also acquire new Gear while out on a mission, provided Coach adds it to the scene. He'll let you know if and when this happens, and you'll have the option to add it to your inventory if you have the space. Gear acquired in this spontaneous manner is considered "loot" and does not cost any initial Armory points when found.

**Remember:** You can't use your Armory requisition Gear of a tier higher than your current Class, but you *can* use any new Gear acquired in the field. Just be careful when using new Gear that is clearly out of your class, as it may have unintended consequences!


#### Returning Gear

If you are holding onto Gear that you no longer need, you can bring it back to the Bunker to return to the Armory. If the gear is undamaged or only lightly used, Coach may allow you to recover some or all of its initial Armory resource cost.

If you find new Gear in the field, you might be able to bring it back home to add to your Armory. If Coach allows it, new Gear can be researched, assigned an appropriate Tier, and added to the stock, possibly even increasing the Armory resource. Just make sure to not break it before you can bring it home! Once added to your Armory, it *will* require the standard costs in order to requisition later.


### Using Gear

You will primarily use your Gear during Throwdowns, as part of the "Use Gear" Assist Action. When you perform this action, you must choose to either **Activate** a piece of your Gear for a small bonus, or **Sacrifice** it for a greater bonus. Activating your Gear allows you to hold onto it and use it again in a later conflict, while Sacrificing it destroys the item entirely.

Most of the example Gear listed in this book will have different effects that happen when Activated or Sacrificed. Outside of those lists, for any "default" or undefined new items you introduce, we recommend the following baseline abilities for basic Tier 1 Gear:

* **Activate:** You can make an immediate bonus Draw of one card.
* **Sacrifice:** You can make an immediate bonus Draw of three cards.

Regardless of their abilities, each use of Gear requires both a very cleverly-narrated statement of how you wish to make use of the item, and of course Coach's approval that said usage makes sense.

You can use your Gear in Gambits as well, with a one-item-per-Gambit limit. You must declare its use before declaring the final outcome, and it must make sense in the story. By default, Activation allows you to play a second card (choosing the best), while Sacrificing allows you to play *three* additional cards.

You can only Activate any specific piece of Gear once in any given conflict, even if it has multiple actions associated with it! And you can't first Activate and then later Sacrifice the same item in the same conflict - the act of Activation makes a piece of Gear un-Sacrificeable in the same conflict (and the reverse of that is even more so true).


###### (SIDEBAR: Narrative use of Gear)

There may come times outside of conflicts when it makes sense for the Story to be affected by one or more pieces of your Pilot's Gear. There is no hard rule for these situations in this text. If you feel that your Gear would make a difference in a story moment, present your ideas to Coach. He may agree, and allow you to add more flair to the moment, possibly even bypassing potentially-risky Gambits entirely. If so, we recommend that each item have at most a "once per-scene" activation limit, and that you try to make each such moment unique.


### Gear Lists

(wip)

Things Gear needs to note:

* **Activate Effect:** Basic effect when Activated. (default: +1 card draw)
* **Sacrifice effect:** Special effect when Sacrificed (default: +3 card). Sacrificed Gear is destroyed immediately.
* any additional actions?

Possible gear effects (X = gear tier):

* Armor: +X to Buffer
* Tools
* Weapons

Some possible Gear selections for the basic team. In these notations and all following, the "A:" means "Activation effect" and the "S:" means "Sacrifice effect." A "Passive" effect is always active.

**First Aid Kit:** A: restore 2 spent Buffer to any Pilot / S: restore 3 spent Buffers to a Pilot

**Basic Training Armor:** Passive: increase personal Buffer pool by +1 vs +Trauma only.

**Friendship Bangles:** Passive: If *at least two* are in play, each wearer has +1 Buffer vs +Schism only.

**Pocket Pistol:** A: Deal immediate +Trauma to enemy

**Patch Kit:** S: Restore 1 Endurance to Robo (no activation effect)

**Pocket Rocket:** S: Deal immediate +Trauma(4) to enemy

### Tier 5 Gear


## Pilots: Hands

Your brand new Pilot begins her first session of play with a maximum carried Hand of **three (3)** cards, drawn from the Pilot Deck. Between active conflicts, you can never have more or fewer than this number. If you find yourself with more or fewer than your max, discard down or draw up, respectively.

This maximum increases automatically through play, as you Evolve your Pilot. There are a small number of other ways to increase your max Hand, but you'll have to figure those out.

For info on card Hands, see p. XX. For info on Evolving, see p. XX.


## Pilots: Robos

(flavor text pending re-org)


### Robo Basics

(TBD)

**Robos Require Pit Crew:** Each time you bring a Robo into a conflict, it costs 1 Pit Crew, be it at the start or middle of the action. If your Pit Crew is empty, your Robos cannot be used!

**Summon Effects:** These only trigger *once* per Scenario, and only when summoned mid-Throwdown. If the Scenario is more than a couple of sessions long, Coach may allow them to trigger once per Session instead.

**Robo Endurance:** Base endurance = 6 plus your Pilot's Robo Rank (1 to 3). See Robo descriptions for exceptions to this.

**Rider Bonus:** These special powers are only available to you while you are actively piloting the Robo during a conflict.


### The Robos

(individual flavor text pending re-org; will include alternate re-skin options)

#### Anthro-Guardian: Stalwart and Dependable

* **Summon Effect:** When the Anthro-Guardian first joins the battle, the Team can restore a number of spent Buffers equal to your Robo Rank, assigned as you choose.
* **Rider Bonus:** As the stalwart defender, Anthro-Guardian's Endurance equals 6 plus 2x your Robo Rank (instead of 6 + Rank)


#### Eagle: Visionary and Versatile

* **Summon Effect:** As the great hunter, Eagle brings news of the coming storms on the distant horizons. When Eagle is first summoned, if Coach has any Active (face-up) Omens on the table, he must flip one down (without spending it). If Coach does not have any active Omens on the table, you may instead Draw a card.
* **Rider Bonus:** Eagle's flight bestows supreme combat mobility, increasing your Strike by your Robo Rank while in the cockpit.


#### Lion: Fierce and Fearsome

* **Summon Effect:** Lion always bursts into the scene with an inspiring roar, filling your Team with courage and the enemy with fear. When Lion is first summoned, an opponent of your choice must Discard a number of cards equal to your Robo Rank. This cannot force them to discard their final card.
* **Rider Bonus:** While piloting Lion, Counters against your cards have -1 to their Strike, due to the fierceness of Lion's attacks.


#### Panda: Large and Loveable

* **Summon Effect:** Everyone loves the Panda! When first Summoned, she brings with her a pool of special Buffers equal to your Robo Rank, which can only be spent to counter Schism damage incurred by your Team during this battle.
* **Rider Bonus:** Panda Belly Smash! When an enemy hits you with +Trauma during the fight, you can choose to *immediately* shift it to Panda's endurance and then inflict +Trauma.


#### Rhino: Reckless and Ruinous

* **Summon Effect:** Rhino always makes a destructive entrance. When first summoned, Rhino causes +Ruin, and you restore Charges equal to 2x your Robo Rank.
* **Rider Bonus:** While piloting Rhino, all of your Counter actions trigger +Trauma and +Ruin, because Rhino is rough and ready with zero craps to give.


#### Spider: Protective and Secretive

* **Summon Effect:** Spider enters upon a growing network of powerful webs, which can hold together even the most chaotic battlefields. When first summoned, she brings with her a pool of special Buffers equal to her Rank, which can only be spent to counter +Ruin damage incurred during this battle.
* **Rider Bonus:** While piloting Spider, you draw a new card into your Hand every time one of your cards is Blocked, because Spider *totally* saw that coming.


#### T-Rex: Hungry and Horrendous

* **Summon Effect:** T-Rex charges into the fray with a hunger for immediate chewy-chewy-chomping action. If you Counter on the same turn in which you first summoned T-Rex, modify your Strike for that Counter by twice your Robo Rank (ignoring Rider Bonus).
* **Rider Bonus:** While piloting T-Rex, all of your Counters trigger +Trauma but are also -2 to Strike, because T-Rex has a massive bite but tiny widdle arms.


#### Wolf: Loyal and Dedicated

* **Summon Effect:** Wolf brings with it the reinforcement of the hunting pack. When first summoned, draw a number of additional cards equal to Wolf's Rank.
* **Rider Bonus:** As a dedicated member of the pack, Wolf allow you to make an additional Assist action on your turn, as long as its effects target an ally.


### The Final Form

(TBD; wherein the Final Form Positions and their Techs are described; when to describe the final form; etc)


#### Final Form Positions

There are seven unique Positions that can assemble together to create the Final Form. When the team enters the Rumble stages of a Throwdown, one of them *must* pick the Head, and the others must each pick a different one.

Each Position gives a special Rumble Tech. Activating a Rumble Tech costs 1 Robo Charge, with an effect "X" being equal to the current stage of the Rumble (1-4). Each time you use a Rumble Tech, you must yell out your special move's name. Make them up for yourself!

Aside from the Wing, each Tech may be used only once per Rumble, so use them wisely!

The Positions and their associated Techs are:

**The Head (required):** Each other Pilot in the Final Form may choose to pass you up to X cards from their Hands. You may choose to keep any of those passed to you. You may also choose to pass each of them up to X cards back. The amount they passed you and the amount you pass back do not need to be the same.

**The Heart:** Each Pilot other than the Heart may choose to draw up to X cards into their Hands.

**The Hand:** Re-use any one Rumble Tech previously used in this battle.

**The Foot:** Opponent must randomly discard X cards.

**The Sword:** Apply immediate +Trauma:Opponent(X)

**The Aegis:** Restore X lost Robo Endurance, or gain X additional buffers

**The Wing:** (**Playtest this**) Special Tech. You draw 1 card and move the Rumble to a new Location. This Tech may be used once per Stage of the Rumble.




## Pilots: Strike Ranges

Your **Strike Range**  (also simply called **Strike**) sets the maximum *safe* difference between cards that you can play during Throwdowns. You can *always* play outside of this range if you have no other options, but doing so triggers a +Schism microevent that can damage team Harmony! Your Strike begins at an amount determined by your Commitment to the Fight Stats, and can be modified by Gear, Techs, and more. See p. SQUARP in the Throwdown section for extended rules on Strike Ranges.


## Team Basics

In addition to (and perhaps in some stories even more crucial than) the individual Pilots, the Team as a whole is practically a character unto itself.

Each Team of Gattai Pilots has the following components:

* Team Name (descriptor): What is the team called?
* Derogatory Nickname (descriptor): What is the team called by its haters?
* A central Harmony Tracker
* Team Class Rank: the average "Class" of the combined team of Pilots. This is determined by total Evolutions (see p. XX), and while one or two Pilots may be a grade apart at times, the bulk of the Team will likely advance together over time.
* Three Home Base Locations: Barracks, Bunker, and Hangar
* Three Team Resources:
    * Fan Club: The general reputation of the team in the public eye
    * Armory: how well-stocked the team's gear reserves are
    * Pit Crew: the size and skill level of the team's Mecha support crew

The Names are simple enough. Your group should come up with a team name during the creation session. Likewise, the Derogatory Nickname is what people call them behind their backs - or to their faces even, if their rep is super low! Fail Force Four, The Suck Seven, Lame Kitties, Losertown, etc. The group can come up with their own, or let it emerge during play.

**Harmony** is a color-coded reference for how "in sync" the team is at any one time. The greater their Harmony, the more coordinated they act as a team, and the more powerful their Final Form will be in a Rumble.


## Team: Harmony

**Harmony** is a 7-point color-coded gauge that determines how in sync *the entire Team* is with each other. Harmony can be threatened by the buildup of **Schism**, which can eventually lower the team's Harmony as they act in ways that piss each other off. With a high Harmony, you are a tight-knit, top-notch team, drawing power and inspiration from each other to do your best. With a low Harmony, you are more out of sync with your goals, constantly at odds with one another, and acting in ways that are increasingly detrimental to each other's well-being.

### The Harmony Table

The entire team uses the same singular, central Harmony tracker, and each of their own actions can affect it. Mechanically, your Team's Harmony affects a number of things, detailed in the chart below:

* **Harmony:** A color code for that rank of Harmony
* **Rank:** A numerical rank associated with that color
* **FF Stats:** The number upon which all of your Final Form's stats (Buffers, Charges, Hand, etc) are based during Rumbles.
* **Fuze Max:** The maximum number of Pilots that can participate on one side of a Throwdown.

**Harmony Table:**

| Harmony | Rank | FF Stats | Fuze Max |
|---------|------|----------|----------|
| Red     | 1    | 1        | 1        |
| Orange  | 2    | 2        | 2        |
| Yellow  | 3    | 3        | 3        |
| Green   | 4    | 4        | 4        |
| Blue    | 5    | 5        | 5        |
| Indigo  | 6    | 6        | 6        |
| Violet  | 7    | 7        | 7        |

**Playtest:** As you can see, all of these things are affected by the same rating, that being the Harmony Rank. I'm considering simplifying this in explanation later, but need to first develop an effective and evocative way of imparting this information on the Team Harmony print-out sheet.


### Schism: Lowering Team Harmony

As the Pilots push themselves too hard and act against the spirit of the team, they can accrue points of **Schism** on their Harmony tracker. This usually comes as a result of **+Schism** damage events, most often as a result of striking Dissonant during Throwdowns (see details on the +Schism microevent trigger on p. XX).

Buffer tokens can help mitigate Schism, but only on a limited scale. A Pilot may spend her own Buffers to prevent points of Schism that *she herself* caused, at the time they are accrued. Outside of a few special character Techs, Pilots cannot prevent Schism for each other.

Once the Team has accrued seven (7) points of Schism, they must erase those points (keeping any excess that may have piled on) and immediately lower the overall Harmony one step toward Red.


#### In the Red: Self-Destructive Behaviors

The Harmony tracker can never be lower than 1, although the team *can* still accrue Schism while in the Red. Once the team is in this state, upon gaining a seventh (7th) point of Schism accrual, and for each additional point accrued thereafter, leave the Schism tally at 7 and instead trigger +Trauma:Each (yes, that means to *the entire Team*). This represents your Team's descent into self-destructive behaviors finally taking its toll out directly on their personal well-being.


### Restoring Harmony

Harmony can be restored in the following ways:

* Playing up your Chroma's Harmony Trigger
* Using your Fan Club
* Using certain Gear
* Using certain Techs
* Winning appropriate Gambits and Throwdowns, or involvement in other narrative activities\*

\* Note that not all Throwdowns, Gambits, or other activities will be eligible for Harmony restoration. The situation must make sense, and the conflict needs to be directly related to the improvement of Team Spirit and teamwork, a matter which is ultimately Coach's call. Examples include therapy sessions, team spirit-boosting activities, group interventions, etc.

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** I am certain I need more ways to restore Harmony. This requires more feedback on the current systems, though.


## Team: Home Base Locations

Every new Pilot team starts play with a basic Home Base, which consists of three Locations: Barracks, Bunker, and Hangar, each with its own special associated Boon, in the form of a special Team Resource.

The **Barracks** Location is where the Team rests, relaxes, and lives. The Barracks provides access to the **Fan Club** Team Resource as its Location Boon.

The **Bunker** Location is where the trains and keeps their special gear, and where they retreat to when in need of protection. The Bunker provides access to the **Armory** Team Resource as its Location Boon.

The **Hangar** Location is where the Team's Robos are stored and maintained during downtime. The Hangar provides access to the **Pit Crew** Team Resource as its Location Boon.

The Home Base can grow out over extended play, with new Locations (and Boons!) added and existing one upgraded to be more resilient to enemy attacks.

The Resources are explained further below. For more details on Locations, see the Advanced Locations rules starting on page SQUARP.


## Team: Resources

Each Team's Base (see above) provides three special **Team Resources** as  Boons to the Base's three core Locations. These Resources add an extended management tool that can empower the Pilots in a number of ways. The Resources are: **Fan Club** (provided by the Barracks), **Armory** (provided by the Bunker), and **Pit Crew** (provided by the Hangar).

Each Resource is represented by a numerical stat from 0 and up, ranked as follows:

| Stat | Description                                              |
|:-----|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Depleted                                                 |
| 1-3  | Threatened: basic scraps, minimal team, low rep          |
| 4-6  | Subsistence: maintenance of standard team ops            |
| 7-9  | Surplus: lots to spare, high rep, solid support crew     |
| 10+  | Bountiful! Will be converted to Score at end of Scenario |

Each specific stat uses these numbers differently. For the most part, the three middle ranks are mainly there for narrative color, while the lowest and the highest have the most direct mechanical effects.

With a 0 in any of the three team stats, the Pilots are locked out of using one of their core abilities. On the flip side, zero is the absolute lowest a stat can go, and any resource loss below zero is ignored.

Any resource that reaches 10 or higher during a scenario is considered to be in a state of great bountiful surplus. If the team doesn't otherwise make use of this bounty, any points in this range are directly converted into final Score.

**Resource Conversions:** When in a narratively-suitable position, the Team and convert resources with a 2:1 conversion rate. This can represent donating gear or services to their Fans, recruiting new Pit Crew members from their fanbase, sending their crew on shopping runs, or however else they can describe it.


### Fan Club (Barracks Location)

The **Fan Club** resource represents your team's general reputation out in the civilian world.

The Fan Club can take any form your game wishes, but by default they are considered to be real people active in your game world. You are encouraged to flesh them out with names and stories, and even involve them directly in your games, possibly even as direct plot hooks!

**Spending Fan Club:** You can spend your Fan Club in two ways. First, you can draw on your Fan Club help mitigate potential PR disasters, as they rally to defend your good name against nay-sayers. In this function, your Fan Club serves as an expendable Buffer to mitigate +Disfavor damage.

Second, you can use them for intel. If you have an evening or so of downtime available in the game, you can invoke a **+Tarry** action to spend time socializing with them, maybe via live net chat or even IRL at a local hangout. Doing so allows you to spend 1 point of Fan Club to acquire insights into your current mission, gaining one "clue" into a current mystery - filtered of course through the uncertain credibility of random online fans. Use these sparingly, though, because your fans don't like having to do all your work for you!

**Depleting Fan Club:** If the Fan Club is depleted, you cannot restore Harmony at all! You'll need to find a way to restore your credibility somehow before your Harmony can be improved.

**Location:** The Fan Club is directly tied to the Pilots' Barracks Location. If that Location is Razed, Fan Club points can not be spent or restored.


### Armory (Bunker Location)

The **Armory** represents your Team's collection of stockpiled goods, including extra weapons and other valuable Gear that they can make use of on their important missions battling against the enemy.

**Spending Armory:** Your Armory points allow you to check gear out for missions. Each piece of Gear costs its tier in Armory points (e.g. Tier 1 gear costs 1 point, Tier 2 costs 2, and so on). The points are spent immediately, however if the Gear is returned safely the points are restored. See the Gear section for extended rules (see p. XX).

Pilots can generally acquire Armory Gear at any time their character would be considered to have easy access to their base of operations. If Coach allows it, the pilots can requisition gear in the field for an additional cost per item, at his discretion.

**Depleting Armory:** If the Armory is ever depleted, you cannot make use of your Daisho' active Techs!

**Location:** The Armory is directly tied to the Pilots' Bunker Location. If that Location is Razed, Armory points can not be spent or restored.


### Pit Crew (Hangar Location)

The **Pit Crew** represents the Team's support crew, the folks who work on their Robos and keep them in optimal operational condition. Like the Fan Club, the Pit Crew consists of an actual team of additional characters that are there to help the Pilots on the sideline. You are encouraged to give them names, personalities, and back-stories.

**Spending Pit Crew:** You can spend points of your Pit Crew for two purposes: summoning Robos and repairing them afterward. Each time you involve a Robo in a conflict, you must send 1 point of Pit Crew, representing general wear and tear maintenance.

To repair damaged Robos, it costs 1:2 for Endurance repairs while you're back at Home Base in your team's Robo Hangar, 1:1 if you're making repairs in the field, and 2:1 if you're calling on your Pit Crew for urgent assistance in anything that Coach deems to be a "high-risk situation."

**Depleting Pit Crew:** If the Pit Crew is depleted, you cannot use your Robos at all! You can't Summon them or use their Bonuses, and you won't stand a chance against the BGM!

**Location:** The Pit Crew is directly tied to the Pilots' Hangar Location. If that Location is Razed, Pit Crew points can not be spent or restored until it is rebuilt.
