# Introduction Story: "Collateral Damage"

The dust cleared, and strewn before Team Athena was the flaming wreckage of the Aegis Cargo-Carrier.

As her T-Rex mecha struggled to its feet, Misty could barely focus on her cockpit’s viewscreen. “K-Kenjiro? Oh no, please no -- Kenjiro, answer me!”

Layali bit her knuckles, her Wombat mecha’s cockpit echoing with her labored breathing. “He blocked the missile swarm with the Aegis, Misty. We would be dead otherwise.”

Miho shook her head. “What was he thinking? The Aegis isn’t armored at all!” Her badger-mecha’s claws scratching at the pavement, matching her rising anger.

Nnedi donned her visor, knocked loose from the last explosion. “He was thinking of us, Miho. He always said he wanted to be more of a help to us.” Her oversized Panda mech lumbered to a standing position, surveying the ruins of the city.

From within a somber-hued avian mech, Bee’s voice cracked over the radio. “But not like THAT! Damn you, Prince Galkar! You and your blasted Metal-Stalker are going to pay for this!”

The pilots’ video screens fizzled, and were suddenly filled with the image of that same prince, his humanoid features resplendent in his purple skin, metallic gold mane of leonine hair, and eight spider-like eyes. “What’s that Earth saying? ‘Speak the devil’s name and he shall appear?’ Oh, but Team Athena, I’m here already, as your cowardly Kenjiro learned to his cost.” The vain prince ran his six-fingered hand through his thick hair, reveling in the rush of his latest kill. “Luckily for you, I had to expend my entire supply of Swarmers to pull that off, but just sit tight and wait a moment, I’ll be coming closer to finish you off, up close and oh-so personal. My newest Metal-Stalker is named ‘Apex’, and it has this lovely new chainsaw-saber, designed especially for you. I simply can’t wait to test the blade’s edge against your pathetic armor. GLORY TO THE STORM ARMADA! GLORY TO NEO-XERXES! HA HA HA-”

The pilots’ viewscreens shifted suddenly to show Evelyn in Mission Control, adjusting her glasses. “I’ve jammed Galkar’s transmission, team, but he’ll be upon you in just a few moments. I have good news and... bad news."

Miho's voice was a snarl. "We just saw your fiancee DIE in front of us, and that's all you have to say? YOU HEARTLESS HARPY!"

Evelyn's jaw clenched. "...Yes. Yes I am. And that's the bad news. Kenjiro’s dead. Sensors confirm it. He's gone. He's... gone." She looked up, her cold brown eyes churning with a barely restrained rage, and her voice dropped to a cold and almost mechanical monotone. "The good news is that the Neo-Xerxes missile Charge has cleared the field. There's nothing stopping you from initiating Prime Fusion, because any civilians that might’ve been endangered from the Fusion Shockwave have already evacuated, or… didn’t.” As her gaze flickered across the casualty and collateral damage estimates from Galtar’s missile Charge, the ice in her voice cracked. “FORM ATHENA PRIME AND MURDER THAT BASTARD. That's an order, pilots!"

Nnedi swallowed loudly. "Omega clearance confirmed, mission control. Athena Prime matrix is initialized. Gold Panda, standing by. We love you, Kenjiro." She yanked back hard on the Fusion Throttle by her side, her clenched fists trembling.

Bee wiped away a tear. "Omega clearance confirmed. Black Phoenix, standing by. We never did get to go to the zoo together, Kenjiro. Damn it all..." Her Fusion Throttle pulled, Bee leaned forward, ready to burst into action.

Layali put her folded photograph, showing Kenjiro cooking at the team’s barbeque party, back into her pocket. "Omega clearance confirmed. Red Wombat, standing by. I miss him already." Another Fusion Throttle activated, and the air around the team began to shudder as power built up among the five mecha.

Miho was practically grinding her teeth down to the gums. "Omega clearance confirmed. Blue Badger, standing by, and I'm going to freaking rip out their spines for what they just did to Kenjiro-kun." As her Throttle was pulled back, the whine of rising energy grew louder.

Misty closed her eyes and took a deep breath. "Omega clearance confirmed, Pink T-Rex ready to initiate Fusion Call. Kenjiro, I never got to say I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry." With her team's eyes upon her, Misty looked up, and threw open the last Fusion Throttle with a savage pull. "ATHENA PRIME IS GO! STRIDE FORWARD, PRINCESS OF WAR! FOR KENJIRO!"

As the Fusion began, Prince Galkar’s Apex crested the hill above the battlefield, eagerly awaiting its next command, a sleek blend of cybernetic chrome armor plate and glistening scaled flesh, forever obedient to the steel cockpit embedded in its chest. A malevolent knight of twisted honor, the myriad missile launchers on the Metal-Stalker’s back and shoulders still trailed thin wisps of smoke.

Prince Galkar took in the scene from inside his armored cocoon, smiling as he saw the familiar silver-white shockwave burst from where those five mechanical beasts had stood only moments before. “This time will be different, Team Athena. This time, our long war ends at sunset, and I will bury you all with your meddling friend.” His fearsome machine drew its gleaming Saw-Saber, and charged down the hill towards its destined enemy. “EN GARDE, ATHENA PRIME! TASTE THE STEEL OF NEO-XERXES!”

The final battle had begun.


# Author's Note: This Game Is Not Simple

**Dear Reader:** Let's put all the colorful flavor text aside for a moment. I want to make this clear at the start. This is a strategic story-driven role-playing game, and it is not a simple one. This is not a pick-up-and-play game, and you'll need to read the whole thing in order to run it. If that hasn't immediately turned you away, then read on, as some explanation follows.

Throughout the development of ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!***, I have struggled with my own internal conflicted design and player tastes. I am a huge fan of simplicity in play, such as the super-light Apocalypse Engine games as well as the myriad classic-inspired retro-clones that have become popular in recent years. I run and play those games quite frequently, and appreciate the ease of approach that they present.

My love for that style of design has weighed heavily on my brain while writing this game, so much that I began second-guessing myself with each and every new tactical decision I put into its core flow. With every new Tech, Color concept, and process change, my brain repeatedly nagged at me to not "break simplicity" - whatever the heck that is supposed to mean. Core components that I had initially loved were suddenly being doubted, and many rewrites and triple-takes followed. For a while, the results were a conflicted mess that I was increasingly dismayed with.

So I decided to kill those nags, scrap all the mess, and just "do it my way." In the end, I chose to focus on making a game that leans heavily on both narrative and technical strategy. Simplicity was partially sacrificed in favor of "layered complexity" mechanics that could blossom on their own. There are multiple layers to this system, and there is great opportunity for mastery over time.

Just like this system's predecessor ***Motobushido***, you'll find that there is more here to master than meets the eye. You will need to read the book through at least once in order to grasp the concepts, but hopefully I've presented it in a way that makes it both an enjoyable and educational initial read. It isn't a simple game, but with mastery it can be both fast, rewarding, and incredibly fun.

**TL;DR:** This game is not simple to pick up and play, but it is hopefully fun to learn, and exciting to master.

For those of you looking forward to the challenge, I say: *Stride Forward, Princess of War!*

# Welcome Freshmen!

(quick overview of the whole game system, what to expect in a game; session setup and expected flow, multi-session advice and flow moved here)

(NOTE: Redesign of the intro section in progress. Goal: School freshmen welcome manual, with italicized mini-example rules descriptions alongside)


#### Terminology Notes:

When this text refers to "players" it includes *all* those at the table who are involved in the game, Coach and Pilots alike. For purposes of clarity, when rules are meant to refer only to Coach or the Pilots, they will use those specific terms. The term "Pilot" is often used to reference both the Pilot characters *and* their players, but *never* Coach.

This game welcomes players of all mixings of genders (and lack thereof). For sake of instructional distinction, specific pronouns have been chosen in the actual game text. These pronouns are used entirely for clarity of text, and are specifically inspired by the very first media on the list of inspirations below. The pronouns "she" and "they" are used interchangeably within the text in all cases of reference to the Pilots and their players. The pronoun "he" is used in all references to Coach.


## Inspirations:

The following media sources provided *immense* amounts of inspiration for the conception and further development of this game:

* *Gunbuster* & *Majestic Prince*: This game is basically a love letter to those two series.
* *Vandread*: ...okay and this one too.
* *Voltron*: Because *duh*
* *Steven Universe*: I'd be a liar if I said I hadn't already planned out gem-themed team colors...
* *Chroma Squad*: Best (and only?) super sentai video game I've ever played (motorcycle chapter is best chapter).
* *Dai-Guard*: I can't get that theme song out of my head!
* *RWBY* and *gen:LOCK*: Rooster Teeth really *gets* teamwork-based stories, and these two shows are some of the absolute best.
* *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power:* Not only is the theme song super badass, the show is a great portrayal of how intra-team conflict can drive a great heroic story.


## The Golden Rules

* **The cards are subordinate to the story.** If you play, draw, discard, or affect a card in any way, you *must* provide suitable in-game narration of such.
* **Don't Ask; Do It.** - If you want your Pilot to do something in the story, don't ask Coach or the other players if you "can" do it. Say what you are going to do, and see if anyone challenges you. Take the initiative, and keep the conversation moving!
* **There are *no* Take-Backs.** If you put a card down, it's down, regardless of its source and/or facing. Think before you play.
* **Card Ranks beat Card Suits.** A King of Clubs beats a Ten of Hearts beats a Seven of Spades.
* **Card Suits break ties.** Seven of Spades beats a Seven of Clubs. Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs (Remember: Reverse Alphabetical Order).
* **One Conflict Per Conflict.** In other words: no cheese-train conflict sequences in this game. If a card-play conflict fails to fully accomplish what you want from the moment, you cannot immediately start a new one to try it again. You must step back, reassess, and come up with a new approach. If that leads to a nearly identical conflict in a follow-up scene, that's fine, but no immediate re-tests should be allowed without a significant change to the story's current environmental and narrative parameters.
* **Explicit Card-Talk is Prohibited.** Players can not reveal or directly discuss the contents of their Hands with each other, unless in-game mechanics (namely Techs) explicitly state otherwise. You must instead talk strategy in-game, as your characters, and not meta-game the conflicts with cheaty card-talk. See rule #1.


## Your Pilots, Your World, Your Story

The setting of this game is intentionally low on details. I want groups to come up with their own world stories, and then tell me about them. Much like *Motobushido* had a loosely-implied post-apocalyptic theme, *Gattaibushido* has a basic "Earth vs the Space Monsters!" theme to it that the players are encouraged to take in whatever direction they choose.

The only constants are: Battle School, Color-Themed Mecha Pilots, Giant Transforming Robots, and Big Giant Monsters. And heck, even those can be defined however you wish. Maybe your "school" is a corporate proving arena, maybe your "pilots" are sleeve-jacked body-hopping trans-human consciousness clones, and maybe your Giant Monsters are a metaphor for corporate war. It's all up to you.

Some Major Game themes:

* "I need to be friends with these other girls, or the rest of humanity will die."
* "I need to be the best I can be, but there's all these life problems getting in the way."


## School Supplies

Make sure you have the basics:

* **Pencils and Paper** are the core tools of every student in Battle School, and you will make heavy use of them here. You kids might think you’re clever with those special digi-pad-whatsits, but when they eventually suffer a glitch and the Meta-Skein crashes, you’ll be glad you kept the old standbys on hand!
* **Playing Cards** are absolutely necessary for play, and you’ll need two separate decks - one for the Pilots, and one for Coach. They’re also great for after-hours poker games in the barracks, but don’t let Coach find out you’ve been gambling!
* **Tokens or counters** of different colors will be useful for tracking the fluctuating levels of damage that your Pilot and her Team will experience during play, and for use as Power Tokens on the Final Form Positions.
* **Pilot Playbooks** should be printed out in advance so you can each easily choose your team roles and first year school courses (aka "character creation").
* **Pilot Record Sheets** allow you to keep detailed ongoing notes of your stats, abilities, skills, and class grades. Be careful now, these are your permanent records!
* (***Still In Development***) The Team Harmony Tracker is required to keep up-to-date stats on your pilots’ harmonic frequencies with each other. Put one of these on the table for everyone to see.
* (OPTIONAL) *A four-sided gaming die* might be useful for certain random moments, if you'd rather not burn through cards for them. 8-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided also work, as they are all divisible by 4.


## Introduction to Play

One player takes on the role of "**Coach**" and leads the proceedings. Coach is responsible for guiding the game along and keeping the team focused on their story goals. If you're familiar with other tabletop role-playing games, think of Coach as the "game master" role.

The rest of the players take on the roles of the "**Pilots**" and explore the story as presented by Coach. These player characters are responsible for driving the story forward in pursuit of their various agendas, both personal and team-focused. Oftentimes those agendas will clash with one another - since they're by default expected to be strongly passionate youths, this conflict is entirely expected. More often still, they will face direct opposition from space monsters and other dangerous threats, the likes of which they have dedicated their lives to fighting in order to protect the future of humanity.


### The Pilots

The Pilots are the core focus of every game. This is the story of their lives and times, their dramas and sorrows, their wins and losses. They must balance the stresses of their schooling and social lives while also pulling together to save the world from invading space monsters.

On the Pilot's Record Sheets are a handful of core game components that you should know about. First are their **Commitments**, this game's version of "attributes." Each Pilot has three core Commitments that frequently come into conflict with one another: **to the Team**, **to the Fight**, and **to Yourself**, sometimes shortened to just **Team**, **Fight**, and **Self**. The numerical ratings of these three stats determine the base mechanics for every extended game component.

The Pilots also have three special empowering tools at their disposal: their **Color Role**, **Power Weapon**, and personal **Robo**. A Pilot's Color Role both sets the color of her outfit and defines the greater role that she plays in her team. Functioning similarly to a "character class," Colors provide unique mechanical **Techs** and extended role-playing inspiration. A Pilot's Power Weapon is that singular awesome tool she is most known for using in combat. Power Weapons start with a basic form and function (and associated weapon Techs), and can grow mightily over time. A Pilot's Robo is the badass giant Mecha that she pilots in the field against the invading monsters. Robos each come in different forms, and give their Pilots even more cool powers to use while in the cockpit. Oh, and they can also merge their robos together for even more power!

Pilots have access to a couple of expendable resources over time, called **Buffers** and **Charges**. Buffers are their reserves of ability to resist the different types of damage thrown at them during play. Charges are constantly-fluctuating pools of energy that let them power up the various Techs bestowed to them by their Color Roles, Power Weapons, and Personal Robos.

Speaking of damage, the world out there is full of many dangerous entities, all of which can bring harm to the Pilots, their allies, and the places they are trying their best to protect! These are most commonly enacted through **Microevents** which activate via **+Triggers** of different natures. A lot of these happen in the background, so for now, just know that it's not going to be an easy fight, and you need to be careful out there!

Over time, as the Pilots experience conflict and victory and more, they will learn from their trials and hone their abilities. By acquiring **Lessons** and subsequently learning from them, they convert those Lessons into **Evolutions** which allow them to both increase their existing powers, and acquire new ones as well.

Additionally, sitting central between all of the Pilots at the table is another gauge called **Harmony** that affects the *whole team* as one unit. Harmony is a 7-step gauge that determines how strong the Pilots' "team spirit" is at any one time. The higher their collective Harmony, the better they will be at pursuing their goals and eventually **Fuzing** into their **Final Form**. Pilots who stress themselves out can lower this Harmony and damage the team spirit, so be careful out there!

The Pilots' Team itself is also a greater unit of play, with its own stats and mechanics. The Team begins play with its own special Base of Operations, which starts with three core **Locations**: the **Barracks**, the **Bunker**, and the **Hangar**. These Locations in turn provide three special **Resources** that the Pilots can draw from, and must manage throughout their adventures: the **Fan Club**, the **Armory**, and the **Pit Crew**. These Resources connect directly to Pilots' own core Commitments and extended tools, both empowering and limiting them in turns. In addition to their Home Base, they will encounter other Locations too! Each will have its own unique game-affecting boon that the Pilots can receive while exploring them.

Finally, the team can equip themselves with extended load-outs of **Gear**. These special tools and weapons can give them minor (but sometimes crucial!) boosts in the field. As the team gains more experience, they can unlock more equipment options, too!


### Time and Immediacy

All of play will take place inside of **Scenes** and **Conflicts**. A "Scene" is essentially defined as "a thing at a place at a time." It's an extremely loose system of narrative structure, and its scope is largely up to Coach's determination. Scenes are often punctuated by "Conflicts" wherein the Pilots' abilities are tested against nature, chance, monsters, or even each other!

It is very important for each mission in the game to be underscored by a growing feeling of "pressing urgency." The enemy is forever marching slowly toward the completion of its nefarious goals, bringing humanity closer and closer to the brink of disaster. While there may be a number of situations where the Pilots may need to lay low and recover their temporary losses, the enemy never waits. Balancing needs of rest with the immediacy of the looming Threat is a major aspect of play. While it is up to Coach to incorporate this urgency into the ongoing narrative, the game also provides a mechanical way to ramp up the tension via Coach's **Crisis** track.


### The Cards

All aspects of mechanical concern are resolved by plays and draws from two separate decks of playing cards. The Pilots get a single Deck that they play from as a team, and Coach gets another Deck all of his own. The Pilots *never* touch or play the cards from Coach's Deck, and vice-versa.

Given that neither side should ever touch the other's Deck, henceforth this text uses the term **The Deck** to refer to the relevant Deck of cards as determined by context. If the Pilots are told to draw from The Deck, this refers to the Pilot Deck, and likewise with Coach and his own Deck. The extended and fully-detailed card Rules are explained in the later *Cards and Conflicts* section of these rules, but for now there are a few core concepts behind them that you should know before reading much further.


#### Card Conflicts

The players will experience three core types of conflict, each of which involves the playing of cards. **Gambits** are the first and simplest, designed as quick question-resolvers that mainly serve to create more immediate unexpected events. **Throwdowns** are the larger fights and dramatic clashes that can involve the entire team playing complex card combos back and forth across the table. Finally, **Rumbles** are the "end-stage" fights that push Throwdowns even further, where the assembled mega-robotic Final Form goes head to head against a horrible space monster!


#### Number Cards

The number cards serve as the primary tools of action and conflict resolution in the game. Ten (10) is the highest, while Two (2) is the lowest. Playing number cards against each other is how all conflicts in *Gattaibushido* are ultimately resolved.


#### Face Cards

The "Face" cards - Jacks, Queens, and Kings - are treated as number cards with values of 11, 12, and 13, respectively. Some additional effects and Techs use Faces specifically, making them extra important to many situations.


#### Aces

Aces are super special ultra-powerful cards with a value of 14 - the highest-value card in the game! While this sounds awesome, they also have one eensy weensy little weakness: Twos. Twos *always* beat Aces, and Aces can never be played against Twos!


#### Jokers

Each Deck includes *two* Joker cards, which serve as special Pacing and Crisis intensifiers. Jokers are shuffled into the Deck face-*up*. When a Joker is revealed at the top of the Pilots' or Coach's Deck, they trigger **Omens**. These can favor the Pilots or work against them, depending on how they are used in the story.


### Coach

Coach fills the "game master" role. He sets everything up, manages proceedings, and guides the flow of play. Coach is largely (but *not* exclusively) responsible for introducing story components and pushing along the narrative and events in a way that make for an exciting session of play. Coach is in charge of introducing all of the other non-Pilot story characters that populate the world. Coach manages the Factions, Threats, and Big Giant Monsters that the players heavily interact with through play.

Coach's role is a lot more complicated than the individual Pilots' roles, but to make it easier he actually has much simpler mechanics to manage. While the Pilots have a tight structure of multi-tiered mechanics and stats, most of Coach's mechanics have exactly one solitary stat each, and much simpler arrays of enhancements.


### Factions, Threats, and BGMs

The Pilots will interact with many "non-player" characters throughout their missions, but the three types that matter most are **Factions**, **Threats**, and **Big Giant Monsters**.

Factions are any kind of neutral or friendly force in the game that has motivation and agency within the scenario's story. Factions are meant to be courted by the Pilots, who can gain favor with them and invest external power in them for later use.

Threats are any forces that primarily exist as a danger to the Pilots and their goals. These can be school bullies, oppressive military regimes, crazed space cults, infectious zombie parasites, raging void storms, dangerous natural environments, and yes even:

Big Giant Monsters! These are special "advanced" Threats that have the power to destroy great numbers of lives and cause trillions of Space-Dollars worth of destruction. BGMs are so powerful that the best (and only?) hope of defeating them is for the Pilots to get over their interpersonal squabbles and join up!


## Session Flow

Each session of play follows a basic flow:

1. Session Setup
2. Team Salute
3. Briefing
4. Story and Play
5. Debriefing
6. Session Breakdown


##### (SIDEBAR: The First Contact Session)

> For your first time playing *Gattaibushido:FUSION!*, I ***strongly*** advise that you start the session with the **First Contact** scenario (detailed in the Coach rules section, p. SQUARP), and conclude that session with full-table character creation. First Contact is designed to serve as both a hands-on tutorial to the game's core mechanics and an interactive "Session Zero" live world-building experience. While not *required* to play the game, it can be invaluable for new campaigns and also for new players. See p. SQUARP for more information.


### 1. Session Setup

First create the play space for the session. This includes setting up basic supplies (playing card Deck creation, writing utensils, tokens, index cards), passing out sheets (pilots, harmony tracker, etc), and determining where everyone is sitting. Some Special Considerations:

**Jokers:** Leave the jokers out of the Decks for the moment. They'll be shuffled in shortly.

**Seating Order:** Your seating order at the table is actually pretty important! Where you all sit determines your conflict initiative and flow order, since all action flows clockwise around the table from Coach (at least initially). If you have a few sessions under your wing and wish to strategize the order of your team’s actions, establishing a seating order is the way to do it - but make sure to do it before you get to the table, as that kind of meta-talk is generally discouraged during play. **Seating order for any active session is locked in once everyone completes the Team Salute (see below)!** However, Coach may allow a new group to change mid-game in the first session or two, as the Pilots learn how their abilities interact, and want to experiment with new seating configurations without having to wait 'til the next session.


#### Starting Resources (First Session)

If you are kicking off a whole new team of Pilots in a brand new scenario, their initial Harmony, Armory, Fan Club, and Pit Crew ratings will be determined by the Team Creation process.


#### Recurring Resource Changes (Second Scenario and Beyond)

**Harmony:** At the beginning of each new Scenario, Coach will most likely alter your Harmony rank from last time. This may be due to specifications written into the scenario itself, or due to events on the Downtime Draw Table (in Coach's Handbook). Additionally, some Playbooks will affect Harmony each time a new Scenario begins.

If the team's Harmony is below Green at the start of a new *session*, each Pilot must name one thing that the others have recently done to piss her off (the lower the Harmony, the greater the offense). Conversely, if the team's Harmony is somehow above green, each Pilot must state one thing that’s super awesome in her life, awesome enough that it could make others jealous. These can be previous in-game events, or even whole new off-screen things that happened between sessions, mentioned at the game now for the first time ever. This is a prime moment to sow the seeds for some juicy intra-team conflicts!

**Armory, Fan Club, Pit Crew:** Some Playbooks have recurring modifiers to these resources. Apply them to the running totals at the start of the *first* session (only) of each new *Scenario*.


#### Draw Starting Hands and Finalize the Decks

Pilots' each draw their starting Hands of cards, based on the Team's current Harmony. Some characters will have special modifiers that increase this, as well. Coach also deals himself a starting Hand equal to the number of Pilot Players present in the game session.

After this is done, both sides shuffle the Jokers back into their Decks, face-up. The Decks are now prepared for play.


### 2. Team Salute

Kicking off the game with a proper team salute is a crucial part of every session. The typical team salute involves each player first standing up around the gaming table. Coach then puts forth his hand, face-down, and the other players do likewise, stacking their hands atop each other until all are joined up. Then as one, they throw their hands up and yell "Go team!"

If your team's Harmony is particularly low this session, I encourage you to get started role-playing right now by letting it show in how you salute, by frowning, scowling, acting out of sync or erratically, or even just plain flipping everyone off. Likewise, if you are particularly high in Harmony, let your Team Spirit show here by leading the cheer and making it extra special!

Each group is encouraged to customize their own salute by changing up the motion, adding a different shout, or trying out some other modification, including an entirely different one!


### 3. Briefing

If this is the first of a new scenario, Coach kicks off the story with a quick Briefing, detailing the current state of affairs with the Pilots' lives, and the status of their overall fight against The Enemy.

If this is another session in an ongoing Scenario, then Coach instead recaps the previous session's events, delegating some or all of the recollection to the other players as he sees fit.


### 4. Story and Play

The majority of actual game play happens during this stage of the session. The Pilots work both separately and together to pursue their agendas in the story, overcoming challenges both personal and grand in scale. This part of the session continues until Coach brings things to a suitable stopping point.


### 5. Debriefing

Once Coach closes the session's play, it's time to quickly recap the events of the session as a group, so everyone is caught up to the state of the story affairs as they are being left for the time being. All post-session mechanics occur now, including any end-of-session/scenario character analyses, alterations, and evolutions.

If this marks the completion of the current scenario as well, then Coach runs the group through an epilogue of the events thus far. This also includes tallying the team's final Score of the adventure, to determine if they have attained any bonus resources and/or evolutions.


### 6. Session Breakdown

Once all play and story wrap-up is complete, pack up all the materials and store them handily for next time.

**Factions:** If this is an ongoing scenario, keep any existing-and-invested Factions as they are currently, using baggies, paper clips, or other such simple storage to keep their current cards invested. This way, the next time you meet you can put them back into play exactly as they were without having to dig cards out of the Deck.
