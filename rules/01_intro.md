# Author's Note: This Game Is Not Simple

**Dear Reader:** Let's put all the colorful flavor text aside for a moment. I want to make this clear at the start. This is a strategic story-driven role-playing game, and it is not a simple one. This is not a pick-up-and-play game, and you'll need to read the whole thing in order to run it. If that hasn't immediately turned you away, then read on, as some explanation follows.

Throughout the development of ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!***, I have struggled with my own internal conflicted design and player tastes. I am a huge fan of simplicity in play, such as the super-light Apocalypse Engine games as well as the myriad classic-inspired retro-clones that have become popular in recent years. I run and play those games quite frequently, and appreciate the ease of approach that they present.

My love for that style of design has weighed heavily on my brain while writing this game, so much that I began second-guessing myself with each and every new tactical decision I put into its core flow. With every new Tech, Chroma concept, and process change, my brain repeatedly nagged at me to not "break simplicity" - whatever the heck that is supposed to mean. Core components that I had initially loved were suddenly being doubted, and many rewrites and triple-takes followed. For a while, the results were a conflicted mess that I was increasingly dismayed with.

So I decided to kill those nags, scrap all the mess, and just "do it my way." In the end, I chose to focus on making a game that leans heavily on both narrative and technical strategy. Simplicity was partially sacrificed in favor of "layered complexity" mechanics that could blossom on their own. There are multiple layers to this system, and there is great opportunity for mastery over time.

Just like this system's predecessor ***Motobushido***, you'll find that there is more here to master than meets the eye. You will need to read the book through at least once in order to grasp the concepts, but hopefully I've presented it in a way that makes it both an enjoyable and educational initial read. It isn't a simple game, but with mastery it can be both fast, rewarding, and incredibly fun.

**TL;DR:** This game is not simple to pick up and play, but it is hopefully fun to learn, and exciting to master.

For those of you looking forward to the challenge, I say: *Stride Forward, Princess of War!*
