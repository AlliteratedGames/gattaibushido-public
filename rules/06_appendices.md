# Appendix A: Final Acknowledgements

To Luke Crane, creator of *The Burning Wheel Roleplaying Game*: Burning Wheel taught me that a fun role-playing game can be both modern and complex, requiring strategy and mastery. Of all the games that inspired me on this project, Burning Wheel is the one that keeps coming back into my brain when I need to justify a strategic decision. ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** would not exist without Burning Wheel.

# Appendix I: Inspirations

The following media sources provided *immense* amounts of inspiration for the conception and further development of this game:

* *Gunbuster* & *Majestic Prince*: This game is basically a love letter to those two series.
* *Vandread*: ...okay and this one too.
* *Voltron*: Because *duh*
* *Steven Universe*: I'd be a liar if I said I hadn't already planned out gem-themed team Chromas...
* *Chroma Squad*: Best (and only?) super sentai video game I've ever played (motorcycle chapter is best chapter).
* *Dai-Guard*: I can't get that theme song out of my head!
* *RWBY* and *gen:LOCK*: Rooster Teeth really *gets* teamwork-based stories, and these two shows are some of the absolute best.
* *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power:* Not only is the theme song super badass, the show is a great portrayal of how intra-team conflict can drive a great heroic story.


# Appendix O: One-Shot Games

TBD (details on adjusting the game for one-shot play, running with or without a First Contact, using pregens, etc)


## One-Shot Crisis Paths

We've presented an alternate shorter 7-step version for Coaches who want to run a much quicker story. It's meant for a standard single-session game, such as a pick-up game or a convention session. If you have new players, you might event want to reduce this to 5 or 6 steps, while experienced players who push through the Deck quickly might instead warrant extending it to 8, 9, or even 10.

A standard one-shot Path is:

| Omens | Event        |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | Wave         |
| 2     | Wave         |
| 3     | Storm        |
| 4     | Wave         |
| 5     | Wave         |
| 6     | Storm        |
| 7     | BGM Attacks! |

A "Steady and Hard" more difficult path is:

| Omens | Event         |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | Wave          |
| 2     | Wave          |
| 3     | Storm         |
| 4     | Storm         |
| 5     | Storm + Wave  |
| 6     | Storm + Storm |
| 7     | BGM Attacks!  |

To provide suitable challenge for one-shot Robo Rumbles, add the BGM's Threat rating to Coach's Hand Limit and Draw on each round.
