# About this Playtest

This document contains information for those who would join our Open Beta playtest stage of development. We are now in **STAGE TWO** of public beta testing.


## What's Missing?

The following components are still missing or incomplete as of Beta Stage 2, released Dec 02, 2019:

* Most of the "flavor" text is unwritten, pending the final production reskinning of the text. **The production document is already in a formatting stage** so final flavor text will appear there first, to keep some fun surprises for the release version.
* Pilot advice is still pending final write-up, which will happen following further play results of the new beta rules draft.
* Coach's advice is similarly pending a rewrite, following further playtests.
* Scenario Final Score is still a work in progress pending a lot of playtest results. There are a few placeholder references to it in the manual, ignore them for now.
* The gear list is very much a work in progress. Recommendations are welcome!


## What is Needed?

### 1. Concept Execution

Play this game "in good faith" and let me know if it works for you. Stick with basic concepts, don't try to super-optimize characters just yet. Tell me how it shines, tell me how it doesn't. Does the concept match the execution?


### 2. Stress Test

Play this game again, and this time try to break it. Build broken character combos and go to town. Tell me how easy it was to achieve maximum game breakage. Tell me how you think certain concepts can be countered, with minimal exception-based tweaks.


### 3. Specific Notes and Requests

A few things that I am concerned about, or specifically seeking input on:

* Individual Playbooks are not built yet, to minimize data drift across versions. Once the core things are finalized, they'll be extrapolated and built out. For now, use the custom build process.
* Gear list is far from complete. Go wild, use your best judgment, and tell me any cool items you come up with.
* I'm not happy with Purple's Techs. I'm mulling over alternatives. I want her whole schtick to be Rebellion, and I'd ultimately like her to have themed techs that are fun to use, but I'm hitting a wall on ideas.
* Most of Branwen's abilities are directly converted from her predecessor Bronson, in Motobushido. I'd like to add two more options to her Primary tech list of choices, but need more feedback.
* Does the document structure work for you? In this case, I'm referring to the flow of the different sections - are rules explanations in places where you would expect to find them?
* Does the "First Contact" scene work? It is derived from the "First Founding" of Motobushido, where it serves the same purpose. What works? What doesn't? How can it be improved?
* Are there any "obvious choices" in the character, power, and Tech options? Are some just genuinely more beneficial than others, to the point of making the others invalid or obsolete?
* Are there enough opportunities to both damage Pilots/Harmony/Factions/Locations and also to repair/restore them? Does there need to be more, or fewer?
* The "No, and..." Gambit results are new, and need feedback, especially when combined with playbook gambit specialties.


### Finally, Tell Me Your Stories

What was YOUR First Contact like? What did your robos end up as? How did your Pilots get their powers? What was your world story?

If you are okay with me adding them as game setting examples, let me know!
