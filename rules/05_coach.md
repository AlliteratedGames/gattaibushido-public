# Coach's Handbook

This whole section is a big ol' Work in Progress. Essentially the "How to GM" section of the text.


## Coaching Tips

(**Playtest:** Unsorted Advice)


### You Are Not the Enemy!

As Coach, your primary role is arbiter (of the rules), narrator (of the world), and challenger (of the opposition). You should note that one role that is very specifically excluded from this list is Antagonist. While you may control the forces that oppose the Pilots, your job is not to destroy them, but instead to challenge them. You guide the actions of their enemies, but you must do so fairly, and not take pleasure in the Pilots' defeats or suffering.


### Draw Inspiration from the Genre

**Watch a lot of mecha anime!** I mean, this part should be self-explanatory! This game's inspirations are *deeply* rooted in both the gattai-mecha and super-sentai genres of anime. That inspiration is visible everywhere from the team Chromas to the exclamatory power names and more. If you are lacking ideas for your next session, check out the inspirations list in the appendices for new sources.


### You Don't Have to Fight the Formula...

**The source genre is pretty formulaic, but that's okay!** In the classic stories, the Pilots go off on side missions, make deals, and get in sword-and-laser fights until the inevitable arrival of the Big Giant Monster of the Week, after which they go all Final Form and kick its butt. This is pretty standard for the genre, and there's nothing wrong with that. The shows keep following that formula because it works, and players of this game will likewise expect it. It's fun, it's comfortable, and it entertains.

What I'm saying here is that you should not feel pressured to avoid the "railroad" style of play in this game. It's practically expected in these stories, and following that flow will make your first few scenarios a lot easier to manage. Stick with the tracks as you learn, they're there to guide you along your journey.


### ...But Sometimes You've Got to Break Free!

Once you've mastered the formula, feel free to totally break from it when you see a good opportunity to do so. That's exactly what the Crisis Paths are for. Using the defaults is fun for a while, but if you keep at them over and over the play can get a little stale. While the basic flow usually assumes that the Pilots spend time pursuing personal goals and gathering power before the inevitable BGM shows up, you don't *have* to follow that pattern every single time.

Using your Crisis Paths, you can switch it up from time to time. Have the BGM attack sooner than they might expect, and plan for it to totally devastate them. After it's done, spend the rest of the scenario focusing on them trying to recover and rebuild from a major defeat. Or instead have multiple successive BGM attacks take place across the story. Keep them working at it, desperately trying to save humanity from destruction!

Your BGM doesn't even have to be a Big Giant Monster, either. None of the BGM's core mechanics actually *require* it to be a "Monster" at all. The players will probably expect a horrible space creature... but what if a Fleet of Alien Spaceships shows up instead? Or what if it's actually a planetary defense system they have to defeat, or a sentient black hole, or even a shadow copy of their own Final Form? Maybe the Pilots have gone rogue, and the "BGM" is in fact the assembled Earth Armada trying to destroy them! The same mechanics apply, and your group's story will benefit from the switch-up.

An even more unexpected change is to exclude the BGM from your scenario entirely! If the players expect a Big Giant Monster to show up at the end of every story, they'll get comfortable in rote patterns of development. By excluding the BGM from your Crisis path, you can spend a scenario or two focusing instead on completely different aspects of the world. Sometimes the core conflict of a story isn't the monsters, but instead the smaller, more personal battles that the Pilots have to fight (who's dating who, gotta win the volleyball tournament, the Space Dance is next week and your rivals are planning a big surprise, etc). Skip the BGM for a game, focus on the personal stories entirely, and you will both surprise the players and also keep the rhythm fresh.


### Keep Them on their Toes

Don't let the team get too comfortable with their synergies! Let them enjoy a solid round-table full-party victory every now and then, but don't let them grow complacent with their killer combos. Put in challenges that split them up, like multiple fronts of enemies, or simultaneous conflicts that require divided attention.

Similarly, don't let individual Pilots get too cozy with one-trick pony shows. If a Pilot is too specced out on Assists, for example, put her in the hot seat from time to time where she needs to overcome challenges all by her lonesome. Conversely, if a "lone wolf" pilot is too cocky, throw her against an obstacle that requires teamwork.

The **Ripple** mechanic can be useful for keeping the story tense, but it requires you to pay real close attention to what the players say and do, both in and out of character. Listen for moments when the Pilots break their personal and team taboos, when their rituals don't get followed, or when they say things like "what's the worst that could happen?" Activate a Ripple and keep the tension high!


### Use Your Threes and Sevens

Three and Seven are the best numbers. They are common in the source fiction, and great for immediate use in play. If you need a quick number in the story, use threes and sevens. The Pilots need to activate three terminals to get inside the secret enemy base underneath the ruins, inside of which seven horrible beasts await them. Seven thuggish rivals jump the lone Pilot when she stays late at the gym to shoot some hoops, and they leave three important items behind in their rush to escape after she whoops their butts. Three groups of seven alien fighter ships block the Team's travel to their mission location, which happens to be in a rare trinary star system.

Once the players are used to your threes and sevens, throw them for a spin with a sudden five or six!


### Other Non-Player Characters

Does Everyone Have to be a Faction or Threat? Easy answer: No, they don't! In ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!***, the only characters that have game mechanics are the Pilots, the Factions, and the Threats. But there are many other characters and creatures in the universe that don't need to fall into these categories. The vast majority of these exist as little more than narrative color, but sometimes you can use them as the components of other game mechanics.

The easiest way to bring in non-mechanics characters is as narrative power behind a Gambit. For example, if a Pilot has offended the locals of a backwoods colony and they are trying to lynch her, instead of statting them out you can just use them as the crux of a Gambit. Can she talk them out of their furor? Can she run away? Can she call on her friends' help in time? Play out a quick Gambit and find out!

Or instead, you can just "say what happens" and move on. There's no need to bring numbers and mechanics into play unless it's important to the greater story. For example, if a Pilot is out on a shopping trip in the Enzirian Bazaar and wants to find something interesting, role-play her interactions with the locals, and describe the fancy new scarf she gets from a pleasant off-world trader. Keep it simple, set the cards aside, and just enjoy the scenery for a while.

Similarly, you can use this same method to build up the feeling of danger in a purely descriptive way. For example, while the Pilots are making their way through monstrous caves on an alien planet, suddenly you describe how a young larval centipede-*thing* attacks them! Instead of throwing down a card, though, see how they respond, and just play it out with words. Let them blast it to smithereens and kick its carcass down a deep pit and move on. Bring more and more of these things into the scene, until you eventually reach a point where you finally feel that it's Throwdown time.


## Coach's Basic Mechanics

(**Still in Development**) Most of the in-game rules that Coach uses have already been detailed in their relative sections prior. This section here is meant to serve as a quick collection of page references to those bits and pieces.


### Coach's Differences

Coach plays the game very differently than the Pilots. Below are the major mechanical process changes that apply to your role in ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!***

**Coach's Hand:** Coach's Max Hand is set equal to the number of Pilot Players in the current game session.

**Coach's Techs:** Just as the Pilots can have a myriad assortment of Techs at their disposal, Coach likewise has his own special powers. These all fall into three groups: Ripples, Waves, and Storms.

**Coach's Buffers:** Your individual Threats each have their own Buffer pools, set by their Threat Ratings.

**Coach's Charges:** Coach doesn't spend Charges to empower his own Techs during Throwdowns. Instead, you *Discard* from your Hand in order to activate these options (Faces for Waves, Aces for Storms).

**Coach's Strike Ranges:** Coach has different limits in regard to Strike Ranges. Unlike the Pilots, who have the ability to play outside of Strike Ranges by risking team stress, by default your Threats are hard-limited by Strike Ranges (set by Threat Ratings) and cannot play outside of them. Some of your custom Threats may have specific exemptions to this, however.

**Factions:** Coach does not have Factions under his control - at least not initially. Factions can be corrupted through Disfavor, and this can result in them becoming new Threats under your control. In either case, you never invest cards into Factions.

**Locations:** TBD


### Coach's Common Tasks

(this will end up being a master reference list of Coach's common tasks)

How to...

* Build a Big Giant Monster: p. SQUARP
* Check for Faction Disfavor: p. SQUARP
* Create a Threat: p. SQUARP
* Introduce a Faction: p. SQUARP
* Run a First Contact: p. SQUARP
* Run a Gambit: p. SQUARP
* Run a Lessons Vote: p. SQUARP
* Run a Throwdown: p. SQUARP


### Keeping Records

Coach should keep track of:

* Each player's various Triggers (from Chroma)
* Team Class Rank (based on the mode value across the team)
* Current Team Resources
* Threats


### Keeping Time Moving

Time and Urgency of the Mission are important aspects of play. The Pilots can choose to go off and do whatever they ultimately want, but if they linger inactive for too long, the enemy grows more powerful as the heroes idle. Occasionally if you feel like the Pilots are screwing around too much with unimportant stuff, or just overly turtling up, subtly remind them that danger is always near, and steer them toward action.

If they still don't get the hint, you can just invoke the **+Tarry** trigger, to subtly let them know that the clock is ticking.


### Structuring Scenes

To use the old adage, a Scene is the "basic building block" of narrative flow in this game. A Scene is a simple term which means "A Thing at a Place at a Time, where *Something Interesting* happens." Think of this game like any of the TV shows that inspired it, and imagine how those stories move along from scene to scene, focusing only on the interesting things relevant to the story. Gattaibushido's use of Scenes is exactly like that.

There's no real need to be super formal with the introduction or conclusion of scenes. Just open it up like a TV show would, by telling the players where the action is happening (a game Location), who's there (the Pilots, other background characters, maybe some Threats, etc), and what is immediately happening to focus their attention (sneaking along, going shopping, training montage, etc). Then ask the Pilots to describe what they're doing, and let the rest happen organically from there.

Likely a Conflict will be called for, and it will probably be pretty obvious when it's that time. But basically, the guidelines are:

* If a Pilot has a question about "Hey, can I do this?" or "What happens if I do that?" are you think something interesting might happen, play out a **Gambit** (p. SQUARP)
* If an argument, fight, or other major clash of interests breaks out, use a **Throwdown** (p. SQUARP)
* If a Big Giant Monster attacks, and/or the Pilots go Full Force and fuse together, it's time to **Rumble** (p. SQUARP)

Otherwise, just keep talking with the Pilots. Ask questions, answer questions, build out the world around them, and create a memorable experience. Remember, you started this Scene for a reason, so at some point you need to either **Get To The Damn Point** or just close it out and move to something more interesting. If you can't think of *Something Interesting* to happen, then it's a lousy Scene and not worth wasting valuable play time on.


#### Per-Scene Mechanics

You might encounter a handful of effects that have "per scene" limitations. Think of Conflicts as entities contained within Scenes. If an ability says it can only be used "once per scene," and it has already been used once during the scene, starting a conflict within that scene does not reset that counter.


### Omens and Jokers

The Jokers and Omens are integral to your control of the story's pacing. They're also a key source of your Threats' powers. The Pilots will balance between using theirs for immediate power and saving them for later, while you must balance between keeping yours out (to empower your Threats) and spending them to push the story along. There's a mess of balancing going on here, believe you me.

By keeping your eyes on the number of Omens in play, you can know how dangerous your Threats will be when conflicts arise. We recommend aiming to keep at least one in play at all times, if you can manage it, either from the Pilots' Deck or your own.

For more on Jokers and Omens, see the basic cards rules on p. XX


### Ripples

As the players explore the story, they may have their Pilots affect the world in unexpectedly dangerous ways. Their actions and intentions can have unintended consequences that aren't always worthy of playing Gambits and Throwdowns.

In such cases, you may still want there to be *some* minor mechanical impact on the game, and that's where Ripples come in handy. Whenever an entirely story-driven portent arises during play, you can choose to visibly Discard a card from your Deck. The following in-game event examples would each be Ripple-worthy:

* A Team taboo is broken inadvertently
* A teammate or ally insults a Pilot's dead father.
* A character rolls three sevens in a game of dice at the barracks.
* Coach manages to Block three times in a row.
* A Pilot unknowingly takes a course of action that helps out the enemy.

The triggers for Ripples are entirely spontaneous, and there is no hard science to bringing them into play. Just be on the lookout for strange coincidences and unintentionally dark moments of story that may arise, and remember your Threes and Sevens. The primary purpose of Ripples is to push through the cards and bring forth new Omens more rapidly.

Omens and Ripples have similar thematic feel, but there is a distinct mechanical difference in how they enter play. Omens are mechanical results of the revelation of Jokers, and are accompanied by additional reactionary narration. Ripples on the other hand are mechanical reactions to "ominous" events and narrations that occur spontaneously during play, and are not reliant upon Jokers.


### Waves and Storms: Your Techs

**Waves** and **Storms** are Coach's core special tools for making the Pilots' lives more complicated and dangerous. Waves tend to have smaller and/or more direct and localized effects. Storms are much more heinous, and frequently broad-reaching.

Waves and Storms come directly from the Threats in any particular scenario. High- and/or Multi-Threat scenarios will likely have multiple Wave and Storm options.

When the rules call for a Wave or Storm, you can only trigger *one* of those available to you, unless the rules specifically say otherwise. When the rules call for a Storm, however, you can choose to trigger a Wave instead.

Regardless of the mechanics, every Wave and Storm *must* have a suitable narrative description. Coach can't just say "Okay, I do a Wave, so Jannys takes 1 damage" and move on. You must describe what exactly is happening in the story that is causing this damage. By keeping aware of your Omens and your Threats' abilities, you should be able to come up with some ideas.

Every Scenario comes default with a basic Wave and Storm event built-in. All others come from custom Threats in the Scenario.

Waves and Storms are primarily triggered by three events during play:

* Crisis Path Steps
* The "Activate Wave or Storm" Assist action in Throwdowns
* Some Threat actions



# Coach: Campaign Structure

If you've made it this far, you've probably figured out that ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** has a somewhat different approach to a lot of the same tasks as other RPGs. However, the biggest hurdle for new players tends to be figuring out the expected flow of process. Hopefully this section can help you get over those bumps and smooth out your play experience.

This game is primarily built and balanced around "campaign" play, meaning that you are expecting to play this story for multiple sessions. I've found that 13 sessions or so tends to make for a good story arc. With proper adjudication of Lessons and Evolution votes, this can see the original Pilots grow into very capable characters - provided they live that long, of course.


## Session 1: First Contact and Creation

Campaigns work best if the group spends the entire first meetup session just talking about the game they want to play, and the story they want to tell. During that process, they should run through the **First Contact** tutorial scene, and then afterward make their characters together as a group.


### Start with a Blank Slate

This means story *and* rules! Don't pre-write the world details, and likewise don't front-load the rules! Trust in the First Contact scene to kickstart both story and rules knowledge, and you'll be good to go.


### Run the First Contact

The First Contact kicks off the game and the grander story. It is both tutorial and world-building session. Every game should begin with one *before* the actual player character Pilots are even discussed at all.


### Run the Team Creation Sequence

After the First Contact, run the Team Creation process. Coach's involvement with this will largely be one of mechanical guidance and "story wrangling," as you ask questions of the group and encourage them to add more details to the world.

When determining the details of the time between the First Contact and the start of the game, help them bridge that story gap with more questions and ideas.

Keep in mind that the default game intends for the characters to all be young Pilots fresh in Battle School. If this is a brand new group of ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** players, I highly encourage everyone to play young neophytes, so they can all experience the new developments together. However, if you have some veteran players, you might consider letting them play more established Pilots, possibly even those who survived the First Contact, if it was recent enough.


### Optional: Enhance Creation with Helper Tools

In recent years, a number of really fantastic gaming tools have become available, several of which greatly enhance the process of character creation in a new game. One tool in particular that I am very fond of is a deck of *Backstory Cards* produced by Galileo Games. These cards work particularly well with ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** games, as they follow a round-table flow of story establishment very compatible with the extended action flow in Gattai. There's even a sci-fi themed expansion for the deck, which adds more thematic components fitting for exactly this kind of game.

This game is not affiliated in any way with Galileo Games, but I've used their cards so heavily in my own campaigns that I wanted to mention them here as a valuable possible addition to yours.


### End the Session There

With the First Contact scene and the subsequent team creation complete, you should now have the foundation of an exciting new game world, and a promising new team of Pilots to explore it. I recommend concluding the first session at this point, so you have time to plan out the first game scenario and have it ready for the next session of play.


## Sessions 2-4: The First Mission

(the "noob gm" suggestions on starting your first mission. take what you set down in the FC, build out an intro plan. start with side stories of the pilots' personal lives. maybe a school scene or two. introduce their first mission through an in-game briefing. expect about 3 sessions of play on it, but be ready for more. extended scenario design details in next chapter.)


### Introducing Extended Rules Systems

(repeat from before: don't pre-load all the rules! bring in a handful of gambits at the start, then get a single pilot into a throwdown, then bring in more pilots on a following one to introduce assists. save the rumble for the end of the first scenario, build up to it, make it awesome.)


### Remember to Take Your Time!

(don't rush through the crisis path unless you already know what you are doing. give the players time to explore their characters outside of battles and conflicts. stop and smell the flowers, factions, and locations too.)


## Sessions 5 and Beyond: Campaign Play

(13 sessions or "episodes" is a good first campaign target. can usually get anywhere from 3-7 scenarios in a standard 13-episode campaign, based on group understanding of the system)


###### (SIDEBAR: One-Shot Games)

> As noted already, this game was primarily designed with campaign focus in mind. Multiple sessions of play allows character concepts to blossom and thrive, and that kind of development is a core intent of the story focus here. However, one-shot and convention games are always a lot of fun, and this game can easily be adapted to fit the confines of such a single-serving gaming experience. For more information on this, check out Appendix O on p. XX).



# Coach: Scenario Development

To develop a scenario:

* Set the Premise
* Establish the Threats
* Add Factions and Locations
* Develop Intra-Team Conflicts
* Build the Crisis Path
* Finalize Waves and Storms

This is presented as an ordered process, but you will most likely skip back and forth between them, as ideas and developments in later steps re-inform prior decisions.


## Step 1: Set the Premise

What's the situation?

What's the first Story Event for the Crisis Path?

What's the Team's buy-in, both together and individually?

What's the Mission Objective(s)?

What's the worst possible outcome?


## Step 2: Establish the Threats

The Threats present in your scenario directly affect its design. Every Scenario should have a "Total Threat Rating" which is an "X/Y/Z" number. X = total number of Threats, Y = Average Threat Rating of those Threats, and Z = number of Threats designated as BGMs. Threats give Waves and Storms.

Threats are more fully explained in the next chapter, starting on p. SQUARP


## Step 3: Add Factions and Locations

Prepare a Faction card for each Faction of the scenario, to be placed on the table when it is discovered by the Pilots.

I can be a good idea to prepare Threat stats for any Faction that you think may potentially be a Threat to the players.


## Step 4: Develop Intra-Team Conflicts

(give the team something to fight each other over! who is picking on who, who is favored at another's expense, what recent events can drive wedges between them, etc. need reasons to hit that Harmony)


## Step 5: Build the Crisis Path

The Crisis Path is a pre-scripted series of event triggers that make the game more dangerous (and interesting!) for the Pilots.


### Building the Path

When you create a new scenario to run, you must build out your Crisis Path. The default path is thirteen steps, alternating initially between your pre-scripted Story Events and your Threats' Waves and Storms, and increasing in intensity over time until the inevitable attack of the Big Giant Monster.

Below is the "standard" default Crisis Path setup. Each "stanza" of four events gets steadily more intense, pushing the drama pretty hard toward the end.

| Omens Spent | Event               |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 1           | Story Event         |
| 2           | Wave                |
| 3           | Story Event         |
| 4           | Storm               |
| 5           | Story Event + Wave  |
| 6           | Wave                |
| 7           | Story Event + Wave  |
| 8           | Storm               |
| 9           | Story Event + Wave  |
| 10          | Storm               |
| 11          | Story Event + Storm |
| 12          | Wave                |
| 13          | BGM ATTACKS!     |

**Playtest Note:** You can add whatever you want to your Path, really. As more playtest data is received, I hope to be able to codify this, and have a greater formula for overall Scenario difficulty. Until then, play around with these, try different combos, and see what works and what doesn't.


### Triggering the First Event

The first item on the Path should usually be a Story Event that introduces (or at least strongly hints at) the conflict of the Scenario. Like all Crisis Path events, you'll need to spend an Omen in order to activate it. But this is a good thing, because it gives the group a bit of time to explore the
pre-Mission setting of the story a bit before the action starts.

Note that since the +Tarry event is based on the current Crisis level, you will probably want to get it raised to level 1 before the Pilots get the idea to start using any Location benefits for free. However, if they are starting off at low resources or otherwise in dire straits, you may instead wish to let them have a few freebies and relax a bit while they set their own stories in motion.


### Moving Along the Path

As the cards move during play and Jokers become Omens, the owners of their respective Decks can Spend their Active Omens to perform special actions. The Pilots' Omens are explained earlier in this text (see p. XX), while yours are explained here.

At any point outside of an active conflict, you can Spend one or both of your Active Omens by flipping them face-down. Doing so triggers the next one or two events on the Crisis Path. Only once they are *both* Spent do you get to return them to your Deck and Reshuffle.

This builds a rough structure for pacing right into the game, while also giving Coach a bit of control on how to time these events for maximum impact. While it is technically possible to sit on the unspent Omens for as long as you want, we highly recommend spending them whenever you can, so as to get more tension and action into the game, and better move the story along!

Once you've reached the end of the path, that *usually* means the Big Monster finally attacks, but that doesn't mean that the Omens stop! Keep them flowing through the Deck as normal. Whenever you spend Omens from then on, they can be Waves (by spending one) or Storms (by spending two).


### Crisis and the Big Giant Monster

The current Crisis has a direct impact on the power of the Big Giant Monster, whenever it is eventually encountered, because the BGM's Hand is directly increased in size by the Crisis level.

The BGM-assigned Threat cannot *initiate* a Rumble until the "BGM ATTACKS!" level of the Crisis has been reached. If you want to whip out the BGM sooner, then you need to push its event further down the Crisis Path. However, there are **two very specific instances** in which the BGM can be "fully summoned" before this point.

**First**, if the Pilots are in a Throwdown against the BGM-tagged Threat and they choose to activate a Rumble, then the BGM will use that moment to go "full beast mode" and likewise evolve to its more powerful form. This immediately moves the Crisis Path ahead to the appropriate level, skipping all preceding events on the Path, and allowing Coach to draw bonus cards accordingly.

**Second**, if the Pilots are in a Throwdown against the BGM and somehow defeat it before the Throwdown ends (usually with mid-conflict applications of Trauma), on Coach's next turn the BGM immediately moves the Crisis Path ahead to the ATTACK stage, and activates a Rumble accordingly.

In either case, if the story is still going after the Rumble concludes, you will likely have to extend your Crisis Path to adjust for potential Story Event restructuring.


## Step 6: Finalize Waves and Storms

Every Scenario comes default with two free basic actions which can be used on Crisis Path triggers:

* The **Basic Wave** effect is a +Trauma:Choice(1) effect.
* The **Basic Storm** effect is +Trauma:Each(1) effect (to **all** Pilots).

These will be on the final Scenario Sheet. Beneath them you should take note of any of your Threats' Waves and Storms that you find particularly noteworthy, to keep handy for future Crisis events.
