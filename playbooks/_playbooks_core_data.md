**Gambit Specialties:** TBD


### Primary Tech

**Rare Pupper!** At each rank of this Tech, including the first, Branwen acquires an ability of your choice from the following list. In each case, the variable X represents her rank in this Tech:

* **"Pilot’s Best Friend!"** (Assist) Branwen can choose to allow up to X of her own Charges to be used by her Bonded Pilot this Turn. These Charges must be spent immediately.
* **"Sic em!"** (Assist) Use before another Pilot makes a Play. Spend 1 Charge, and increase her Strike by +X. This represents any number of actions Branwen could take in assisting the fight, such as gnawing at the leg, flanking attacks, and so on.
* **"Therapy Branwen!"** During the Outcome stage of a Throwdown in which Branwen participated, she can spend up to X Charges to negate the same amount of Schism tokens built up on the Harmony track.

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** Most of Branwen's abilities are directly converted from her predecessor Bronson, in Motobushido. I'd like to add two more options to her Primary tech list of choices, but need more feedback.


### Secondary Tech

**"Look What I Found!"** Branwen can scrounge for pretty much anything, and tends to bring back the weirdest things as “trophies” for her Team. Once per game session while outside of an active conflict, Branwen can go off on her own volition to randomly search for stuff. This is handled as a Gambit with the following results:

* "No, but..." Branwen finds something that is completely useless (but she’s very proud of). If praised for her bizarre (and probably disgusting) discovery, she triggers +Chargeup:Self(TechRank).
* "Yes, but..." Branwen finds something useful (worth this Tech's Rank in Resource points) but gets in big trouble.
* "Yes, and..." Branwen finds something potentially very useful (worth this Tech's rank in Resource points) or otherwise helpful to the Team’s goals (such as a point of invested Favor on a Faction).


### PLAYBOOK SPECIAL

Branwen must declare another Pilot on the Team to be her "Bonded Pilot." While she is spiritually a companion to the entire Team, she is *most* connected to this particular Pilot over all the others. This other Pilot does not have to be Branwen's willing "owner" per se, because in this transaction Branwen simply claims a Bond of her own choosing. Should her Bonded Pilot manage to cross the Rainbow Bridge before she does, Branwen must choose a new Bond.
