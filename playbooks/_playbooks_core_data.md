## Black: The Wild Card (beloved reaper, abundant void)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Black (The Wild Card): -1 Harmony, +1 Armory, +2 Fan Club, +1 Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Black (The Wild Card): -1 Harmony, +2 Fan Club

**Lesson Trigger:** Black earns a Lesson when circumstances force her to follow the predictable path.

**Gambit Specialties:** *All* of Black's Gambits are played Blind from the Deck, and count as her Specialty. If the resulting card is Black, ignore its value and use 12 instead (or 11 in Ichi Mode). If the resulting card is Red, ignore its value and "fail" the Gambit.


### Primary Tech

**New Special Action: "Wild Power!"** (Passive, Black Pilot)

If there's one thing you can always expect from Black, it's that she never does what's expected. When Black plays down a card to Counter or Escalate, she can choose to spend up to her Wild Power rank in Charges, and then Flip the same number of cards from her Deck. She can choose to play any one of those cards instead of her already-played card. If Black plays one of the Flipped cards instead, she can then choose to double the Charge cost and return her initially-played card to her Hand. After a card is selected for Play, Discard the rest.


### Secondary Tech

**New Special Action: "Wild Surge!"** (Passive, Black Pilot)

Black gains power from the whims of chaos, drawing greater boons from both good fortune *and* the looming threats of disaster. When a Player Joker is revealed, Black gains up to her this Tech's rank in temporary bonus Buffers, in addition to the normal Joker effects. When a Coach Joker is revealed, she gains up to this Tech's rank in temporary bonus Charges. In either case, these temporary pools cannot exceed this Tech's rank. When she would spend Buffers or Charges during play, she must spend them from these pools first.


### PLAYBOOK SPECIAL



## Blue: The Brains (strategist, mastermind, all-around smart lady)

(While Red leads from the front, Blue leads from the middle.)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Recurring Mods:**
* Blue (The Brains): +1 to a Resource of your choosing

**Lesson Trigger:** Blue earns a Lesson when she causes disaster through over-thinking and obsessive planning.

**Gambit Specialties:** Logistics, project management, economic planning (i.e. "the boring stuff").

* "**Strategic Foresight!**" (Assist): Spend up to X Charges and look at same number of cards from the top of any Deck. Then return them to the top of that Deck in any order. You cannot tell anyone else what they are. This is the *only* time when a Pilot is allowed to touch the cards in Coach's Deck.
* **Strategic Override!** (Assist): Spend up to X Charges, and up to an equal number Pilots in the Throwdown must discard a combined total of that many cards. Blue's target opponent must discard an equal number of cards. This cannot force them to discard their last card.
* "**Strategic Reassessment!**" (Assist): Spend Charges to draw up to X cards from either the top of the Deck (for 1 Charge) or the top of the Trash (for 2 Charges). Then, Discard an equal number of cards.
* **Strategic Reconfiguration!** (Assist): Spend up to X Charges and take up to X cards from up to X Pilots involved in the fight. You can then choose to distribute up to X cards to up to X Pilots involved in the fight. These do not need to be the same cards or Pilots.
* **Strategic Retreat!** (Assist): Trigger +Schism, then Spend up to X Charges and completely withdraw from the Throwdown. Give the same number of cards from your hand to up to as many other Pilots that remain. You are not allowed to participate further, nor be targeted by the Outcome, but you must participate in the Drop and Draw stage.


### Secondary Tech

**Advance Warning!:** Blue is always prepared for the dangers ahead. Once per Mission Scenario per rank invested in this Tech, when one of Coach's Jokers is revealed, Blue can choose to immediately send it to the bottom of the Deck, skipping all Joker-related events and effects.


### PLAYBOOK SPECIAL



## Green: The Noob (only direction is up, without limit)

(Flavor description pending final release)

2. Orange can now freely exchange her Charges for Armory Resources, or vice versa, at a 2:1 Charge:Armory exchange rate.
3. At during the Outcome stage of a Throwdown, Orange can spend Charges to recover any Gear sacrificed during that Throwdown. Charge cost = 2x Gear Tier.


### Secondary Tech

**Private Arsenal!** Orange is constantly acquiring cool new gadgets and weapons for her private collection, and knows who to talk to to acquire 'special" goods. These may or may not be "regulation" per se, so it's a good thing she's also adept at hiding them away until just the right time! At each rank of this Tech, Orange acquires an additional two (2) Gear slots that can be used for any type. Additionally, she enjoys a discount to all Gear acquisitions equal to her Tech rank, to a minimum of 1 cost.

If the Team's Harmony would drop equal to or below her rank in this Tech, she can choose to prevent any amount of it by triggering +Trauma:Self with damage equal to *twice* the amount of Harmony loss prevented. She can choose to spend her own Charges to soak this damage as if they were Buffers.


### Secondary Tech

**Friendship is Power!:** Pink is always there to get your back, even when everyone else has reached their limit. Pink can use more than one Assist action on the Pilots' turn of a Throwdown. Each turn, her Assist limit is equal to 1 plus her rank in this Tech.

**Recurring Mods:**

**Lesson Trigger:** Purple earns a Lesson when she does that thing that everyone told her not to do, and catastrophically fails at it.

**Gambit Specialties:** The pursuit of any action that the rest of the Team truthfully does not want her to pursue.


### Primary Tech

Purple is not bound by anyone's rules and expectations. She does what she wants, in glorious, dangerous, and surprising ways. She acquires a new special action:

**Middle Finger Scream!** (Assist): This must be played immediately before you Counter in a Throwdown. Spend up to your Tech Rank in Charges, and decrease your Strike Range by twice that amount for your next Push. This can result in a negative Strike Range, which is exactly what you want. If using this power gives you negative Strike, you can Counter with a *lower* card than the top of the Pile, as long as the difference is within the new negative Strike. Your new, lower card is now on top.

* At rank 2, when you counter within negative Strike, you can choose to trigger +Schism anyway. If you do so, increase the multiplier of your Secondary tech by +1.
* At rank 3, when you use this power and strike "Negative Resonant," any excess Buffers and Charges generated by your Secondary Tech are distributed to your teammates as you see fit.


### Secondary Tech

**You don't know me! I do what I want!** Purple draws strength when she causes dissonance within the Team. Whenever Purple triggers +Schism, she restores a number of Buffers *and* Charges equal to her Rank in this Tech. If this occurs in the pursuit of a course of action that she was specifically ordered not to follow beforehand, the amount restored is doubled.

**Recurring Mods:**
* Red (The Captain): +1 Fan Club

**Lesson Trigger:** Red earns a Lesson when she gets everyone into greater danger by charging forth blindly.

**Gambit Specialties:** Athletics, bullheaded bravado, and just plain showing off.


### Primary Tech

When Red seizes the moment of glory and perfection, her valor spreads into the world around her, changing the very nature of the battle. This gives Red the following new Tech:

**Inspiring Strike!** (Assist) Cost: X Charges, and X = current Throwdown stage. Activate when Countering or Escalating with a Resonant Strike. Effects based on rank:

1. Red Draws X cards into her Hand
2. ...and triggers +Chargeup(X) to up to X involved other teammates (excluding Red)
3. ...and inflicts +Trauma(X) to an involved opponent


### Secondary Tech

**Hero Power!** As the Captain of the Team, Red must strive to be excellent at all things, and set an example of strength and reliability for the others. Likewise, she must be able to fill in the gaps between the others' specialties, ensuring the Team is properly balanced. Each time she advances this Tech, she chooses one of the following permanent benefits. Each can be chosen only once.

1. Yellow restores her own Buffers at 1:1 Charge cost.
2. Yellow's max Buffer pool is now equal to twice the adjusted max (Synapse + other mods).
3. Yellow restores her own Buffers at 1:2 Charge cost.


### Secondary Tech

**Protective Friendship!** Yellow is the Tank Queen of damage prevention! When a teammate is targeted by Trauma during a Throwdown in which Yellow is active, Yellow can choose to redirect that Trauma to herself instead. *Additionally* at each rank (including rank 1), pick one of the following powers:

### PLAYBOOK SPECIAL



## Branwen: The Dog (aww whoosa good girl? you are! yes you are!)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Branwen (The Dog): +1 Harmony, +2 Fan Club

**Recurring Mods:**
* Branwen (The Dog): +1 Harmony

**Lesson Trigger:** Branwen earns a lesson when she is deeply admonished by her Bonded Pilot for in-game actions.

**Gambit Specialties:** TBD


### Primary Tech

**Rare Pupper!** At each rank of this Tech, including the first, Branwen acquires an ability of your choice from the following list. In each case, the variable X represents her rank in this Tech:

* **"Pilot’s Best Friend!"** (Assist) Branwen can choose to allow up to X of her own Charges to be used by her Bonded Pilot this Turn. These Charges must be spent immediately.
* **"Sic em!"** (Assist) Use before another Pilot makes a Play. Spend 1 Charge, and increase her Strike by +X. This represents any number of actions Branwen could take in assisting the fight, such as gnawing at the leg, flanking attacks, and so on.
* **"Therapy Branwen!"** During the Outcome stage of a Throwdown in which Branwen participated, she can spend up to X Charges to negate the same amount of Schism tokens built up on the Harmony track.

**PLAYTEST NOTE:** Most of Branwen's abilities are directly converted from her predecessor Bronson, in Motobushido. I'd like to add two more options to her Primary tech list of choices, but need more feedback.


### Secondary Tech

**"Look What I Found!"** Branwen can scrounge for pretty much anything, and tends to bring back the weirdest things as “trophies” for her Team. Once per game session while outside of an active conflict, Branwen can go off on her own volition to randomly search for stuff. This is handled as a Gambit with the following results:

* "No, but..." Branwen finds something that is completely useless (but she’s very proud of). If praised for her bizarre (and probably disgusting) discovery, she triggers +Chargeup:Self(TechRank).
* "Yes, but..." Branwen finds something useful (worth this Tech's Rank in Resource points) but gets in big trouble.
* "Yes, and..." Branwen finds something potentially very useful (worth this Tech's rank in Resource points) or otherwise helpful to the Team’s goals (such as a point of invested Favor on a Faction).


### PLAYBOOK SPECIAL

Branwen must declare another Pilot on the Team to be her "Bonded Pilot." While she is spiritually a companion to the entire Team, she is *most* connected to this particular Pilot over all the others. This other Pilot does not have to be Branwen's willing "owner" per se, because in this transaction Branwen simply claims a Bond of her own choosing. Should her Bonded Pilot manage to cross the Rainbow Bridge before she does, Branwen must choose a new Bond.
