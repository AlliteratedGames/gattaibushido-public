# Gattaibushido:FUSION! RPG Rules Public BETA, STAGE TWO

## About This Repository

This is a repo of all the working design files for the ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** tabletop RPG by N. Phillip Cole of Alliterated Games. I started this with the hope of improving my personal design processes and work flow, and making it easier to both roll back mechanics and carry my work from device to device. As of April 30th 2018, this repo is now publicly available on GitHub, rebased from my original working mess of a private repo.

As of the launch of this GitHub repo, all current and ongoing development of this game will be done in the public eye via the files within. Follow along for the latest updates as I push them out.

The Rules are found in the following sections:

* [Introduction](./rules/01_intro.md)
* [Pilot Creation](./rules/02_pilots.md)
* [Basic Play Rules](./rules/03_basic_play.md)
* [Advanced Play Rules](./rules/04_advanced_play.md)
* [Coach's Handbook](./rules/05_coach.md)
* [Appendices](./rules/06_appendices.md)

Character playbooks are (or will be) found [here](./playbooks/).

Playtest-specific information is further below.


## Using this Repository

**NOTE:** This document assumes the reader has a basic understanding of the workings of Git, GitHub, and the Markdown formatting language.

Most development will be done in the "dev" branch, so if you want to keep up to date with all of the latest changes, that's the branch to follow. Otherwise, the "master" branch contains the latest major playtest releases and versioned tags.

If you have suggestions or questions, submit them in this project's Issues tab before submitting any pull requests.


# Playtest Information Section

What you are reading is a Beta Stage playtest prototype of my upcoming new role-playing game, ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** It began its life as a simple "Voltron-inspired" hack of my previous game, *Motobushido*, but quickly evolved into a whole new beast all of its own. This doc is an intentionally bare-bones, simplified, and stripped-down presentation of the core game rules, devoid of the intended art and stylings that are planned for the final print draft. Much of this text will be changed in that penultimate release, although some of it is already in the process of being themed for the final product.

In ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** you play a team of Mecha pilots in space battle school. You deal with conflicts both social, physical, and interpersonal, while also trying to save humanity from giant space monsters, among other threats. One player takes on the GM-like role of "Coach," while the rest are a team of pilots. The pilots must strive to accomplish their goals while maintaining team unity, so that they can ultimately combine their robots into a final form and defeat the Giant Monster of the Week.

This text is both a game and a toolkit for developing story worlds that share certain common themes. Using these rules, your group will create their own Gattai-action monster-fighting setting, and pit their heroic (and angsty!) Pilots against brand new custom-made monstrous creations that no two groups will share. Even their robos will be unique, with special powers of their own design and description.

This document is very much a Work in Progress. Your feedback is both requested and highly appreciated! If you have any input, please send it my way, through whichever channel brought this to you in the first place. This Beta Playtest document (and likely the official release that will follow) has been designed to follow a format that I *hope* will be most conducive to new reader education. The concepts of play are introduced in a way that I think will make sense both on a first-time read-through and again later when referencing at the table. There are a number of concepts presented early that are crucial to understanding those presented later, and as such I've placed the more "advanced" subjects later in the book. The one section that is specifically set up as a complete reference of "lists" is the section on Character Creation and extended team abilities.

## The "Typical" Game

This game is meant to play out like an episode of any of your favorite team-based mecha-pilot anime series. The team gets a mission that they need to complete, usually involving fighting and/or defending against an alien menace. All the while, they will each have their own personal goals and desires, which will quite frequently clash both with each other and with the mission objectives as well.

The game is built on Scenarios, which usually encompass individual missions. A Scenario is really just like an adventure "module" from just about any other RPG, although less dungeon-crawl-y and more story-explore-y. Extended details on scenario design are in Coach's Handbook.


# Markdown, Git, and Me

The switch to Markdown for me is rooted in a desire to step away from bulkier docs editors and simplify my work. I have been a MS Word user for decades, but in truth only apply a fraction of my knowledge of that beastly program's functions to my regular design work. Using Markdown makes for more portable and publishable documents.

Git has been a clear choice for me as I work with code already. I've never tried using this for non-code design, but maybe this is just what I need to write better game stuff, and keep myself accountable for my own work.

My work flow currently makes use of the following programs:

* [Atom][atom] (I do the bulk of my writing in Atom on Win, Linux, and Mac)
* [QOwnNotes][qown] (a fantastic markdown-formatted note sync tool which works for on-the-go editing and notes via windows, mac, android, and iOS)
