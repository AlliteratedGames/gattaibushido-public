# Gattaibushido:FUSION! RPG Rules Public BETA

## About This Repository

This is a repo of all the working design files for the ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** tabletop RPG by N. Phillip Cole of Alliterated Games. I started this with the hope of improving my personal design processes and work flow, and making it easier to both roll back mechanics and carry my work from device to device. As of April 30th 2018, this repo is now publicly available on GitHub, rebased from my original working mess of a private repo.

As of the launch of this GitHub repo, all current and ongoing development of this game will be done in the public eye via the files within. Follow along for the latest updates as I push them out.

The Rules are found in the following sections:

* [Introduction](./rules/01_intro.md)
* [Pilot Creation](./rules/02_pilots.md)
* [Basic Play Rules](./rules/03_basic_play.md)
* [Advanced Play Rules](./rules/04_advanced_play.md)
* [Coach's Handbook](./rules/05_coach.md)
* [Appendices](./rules/06_appendices.md)

Character playbooks are found [here](./playbooks/).

Playtest-specific information is further below.


## Using this Repository

**NOTE:** This document assumes the reader has a basic understanding of the workings of Git, GitHub, and the Markdown formatting language.

Most development will be done in the "dev" branch, so if you want to keep up to date with all of the latest changes, that's the branch to follow. Otherwise, the "master" branch contains the latest major playtest releases and versioned tags.

If you have suggestions or questions, submit them in this project's Issues tab before submitting any pull requests.


# Playtest Information Section

What you are reading is a Beta Stage playtest prototype of my upcoming new role-playing game, ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** It began its life as a simple "Voltron-inspired" hack of my previous game, *Motobushido*, but quickly evolved into a whole new beast all of its own. This doc is an intentionally bare-bones, simplified, and stripped-down presentation of the core game rules, devoid of the intended art and stylings that are planned for the final print draft. Much of this text will be changed in that penultimate release, although some of it is already in the process of being themed for the final product.

In ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** you play a team of Mecha pilots in space battle school. You deal with conflicts both social, physical, and interpersonal, while also trying to save humanity from giant space monsters, among other threats. One player takes on the GM-like role of "Coach," while the rest are a team of pilots. The pilots must strive to accomplish their goals while maintaining team unity, so that they can ultimately combine their robots into a final form and defeat the Giant Monster of the Week.

This text is both a game and a toolkit for developing story worlds that share certain common themes. Using these rules, your group will create their own Gattai-action monster-fighting setting, and pit their heroic (and angsty!) Pilots against brand new custom-made monstrous creations that no two groups will share. Even their robos will be unique, with special powers of their own design and description.

This document is very much a Work in Progress. Your feedback is both requested and highly appreciated! If you have any input, please send it my way, through whichever channel brought this to you in the first place. This Beta Playtest document (and likely the official release that will follow) has been designed to follow a format that I *hope* will be most conducive to new reader education. The concepts of play are introduced in a way that I think will make sense both on a first-time read-through and again later when referencing at the table. There are a number of concepts presented early that are crucial to understanding those presented later, and as such I've placed the more "advanced" subjects later in the book. The one section that is specifically set up as a complete reference of "lists" is the section on Character Creation and extended team abilities.


## What's Missing?

The following components are still missing or incomplete as of the April 30, 2018 project rebase:

* Weapon frames and qualities are still in need of a bit of further diversification
* Most of the "flavor" text is unwritten, pending the final production reskinning of the text.
* Pilot advice is still pending final write-up, which will happen following further play results of the new beta rules draft.
* Coach's advice is similarly pending a rewrite, following further playtests.
* Scenario Final Score is still a work in progress pending a lot of playtest results.
* Threat creation and powers likely need a few balance passes after extended playtest data.


## The "Typical" Game

This game is meant to play out like an episode of any of your favorite team-based mecha-pilot anime series. The team gets a mission that they need to complete, usually involving fighting and/or defending against an alien menace. All the while, they will each have their own personal goals and desires, which will quite frequently clash both with each other and with the mission objectives as well.

The game is built on Scenarios, which usually encompass individual missions. A Scenario is really just like an adventure "module" from just about any other RPG, although less dungeon-crawl-y and more story-explore-y. The scenario design process is probably going to end up being one of the last sections fleshed out, so for now, here's a quick rundown. Some variables that Coach (the GM) must consider and play out:

* How is the mission assigned? is it an official command from above? A sudden personal quest they just stumble upon? A failed mission from another pilot team that they are now expected to complete? A completely random event that they get caught up in? Something else entirely? Coach must decide this when assembling the scenario.
* What is the mission Objective?
* What dangers are encountered? These take the form of Threats, each with their own ranges of abilities.
* What conflicts (both new and recurring) exist between the Pilots themselves? As they default game assumes that the heroes are a group of teenage girls, it also assumes there is a lot of social strife in the ranks. There should be heavy recurring intra-team tensions, so their Harmony will have plenty of opportunities to be threatened.
* What side events might unexpectedly get in the way of their mission? Are these events connected, or just red herring distractions? Having side stories makes the world come alive, and also gives the Pilots more opportunity to see some action, enjoy their powers, learn the system, and complicate their own lives even further.
* What are the team's weaknesses, and how can you exploit them? Coach must keep an eye out for obvious gaps, and push at them in order to train the team to work harder.
* What are their strengths? Coach should make sure to give them opportunities to make use of those strengths, so they can feel suitably awesome from time to time.


## Playtester Questions

Some very specific questions I am wanting answers to, as they come to me:

1. Does the document structure work for you? In this case, I'm referring to the flow of the different sections - are rules explanations in places where you would expect to find them?
2. Does the "First Contact" scene work? It is derived from the "First Founding" of Motobushido, where it serves the same purpose. What works? What doesn't? How can it be improved?
3. Are there any "obvious choices" in the character, power, and Tech options? Are some just genuinely more beneficial than others, to the point of making the others invalid or obsolete?
4. Do Threats work? Are they too powerful? Too weak? Just right? Does the Wave/Storm + Escalation thing work okay?
5. Are there enough opportunities to both damage Pilots/Harmony/Factions/Locations and also to repair/restore them? Does there need to be more, or fewer?
6. The "Dual Payloads" thing in Throwdowns is something I'm not fully certain is described well. Feedback requested.
7. The "No, and..." Gambit results are new, and need feedback, especially when combined with playbook gambit specialties.


# Markdown, Git, and Me

The switch to Markdown for me is rooted in a desire to step away from bulkier docs editors and simplify my work. I have been a MS Word user for decades, but in truth only apply a fraction of my knowledge of that beastly program's functions to my regular design work. Using Markdown makes for more portable and publishable documents.

Git has been a clear choice for me as I work with code already. I've never tried using this for non-code design, but maybe this is just what I need to write better game stuff, and keep myself accountable for my own work.

My work flow currently makes use of the following programs:

* [Atom][atom] (I do the bulk of my writing in Atom on Win, Linux, and Mac)
* [Simplenote][simple] (which I can make use of for additional on-the-go editing via android and iOS devices)
